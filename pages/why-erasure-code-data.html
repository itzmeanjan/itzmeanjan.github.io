                <p class="blogText">
                    Couple of years ago, I <a class="blogLink" href="/pages/rlnc-in-depth.html">wrote</a> about a
                    specific type of erasure-coding technique called, Random Linear Network Coding or in short RLNC.
                    But today I'd like to use an example to explain how erasure-coding can be useful.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Imagine you have a book with 10 chapters, and you want your friend to read that book.
                    You can mail the book to your friend. But the mail delivery company limits the number of words
                    per mail. So we split the book chapter-wise - sending 10 mails, each for one chapter.
                    This works, but now imagine, the mail service is known for being unreliable - they often loose
                    or misplace mails, send one's mail to another one - in short it can be messy.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    To solve this problem, we can send each chapter twice, resulting in a total of 2*10 = 20 mails.
                    It should work as we have introduced redundancy. But there is still another problem, what if
                    the mail service provider looses two mails such that they are for the same chapter, then your
                    friend will receive 18 mails, which is more than ideal (10 mails), and still not be able to read
                    the book, missing a chapter.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    We can try to solve this problem by using erasure-coding. We take 10 chapters of the book
                    and combine them such that each resulting erasure-coded mail (let's call it ec-mail) contains
                    contribution from all the 10 chapters. Now we will send 20 ec-mails to your friend.
                    As long as any 10 of those ec-mails make it to your friend, they should be able to
                    reconstruct back the whole book. It means each of 20 ec-mails have exactly equal
                    significance. So we don't anymore place trust on the mail delivery company to reliably
                    deliver all the mails, rather we bake-in redundancy in our mails such that they actually
                    become failure proof to a certain extent.
                </p>
                <dl class="blogText">
                    <dt class="highlight">
                        Q: Do we have to send 20 ec-mails to get this level of reliability? Can not we send lesser, say
                        15 or 18?
                    </dt>
                    <dd class="highlight">
                        A: Sure, as long as we send >=10 ec-mails and our friend receives 10 of them, they should be
                        able to recover the whole book. Exact choice of parameter is domain specific.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p class="blogText">
                    This is how erasure-coding is useful in data-in-transit domain. We can extend it to data-at-rest
                    domain with another example.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Let's take a book, which has some sacred knowledge, that we want to protect at any cost.
                    We won't just keep a single copy of the book in a single place, right? We will make 10 copies
                    of the book and place them in different locations - no single point of failure. That should be
                    reliable.
                    No thief should be able break into all 10 of those bookshelves to steal that sacred book, right?
                    Yeah pretty much.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    But think of another problem, bookworms are real and they love to feed on those tasty
                    knowledge-filled pages
                    of the books. In some lunar phase, the same chapter in all those 10 books got eaten by bookworms.
                    Or worse, those bookworms were very hungry and they just ate the whole book, in all those 10
                    locations.
                    You come back couple weeks later and find one chapter of knowledge is missing or worse
                    the whole book is missing. What are you going to do now? The sacred knowledge is gone. What a bad
                    luck!
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Again we can try to protect the sacred book, by using erasure-coding. Let's break the book
                    down to 10 chapters, then combine them such that each of the resulting erasure-coded book
                    (let's call it ec-book) contains contribution from all the 10 chapters. We make 20 such ec-books.
                    We keep them in separate locations like before. As long as any 10 ec-books are unharmed,
                    we can recover back our sacred book. If bookworms collaborate and decide to harm more
                    than 10 ec-books, we can't recover our sacred book. We have again lost the knowledge.
                    Instead of 20 ec-books, we can make 100 and place them in 100 different locations around the world.
                    Costlier, but more reliable than before.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
Simply put, the more redundancy you introduce, the more is the cost, but the benefit is reliability.
Whether it is worth bearing the cost, depends on the gravity of the problem you are trying to solve.

                    Random Linear Network Coding, or RLNC in short, is one such advanced erasure-coding technique.
                    Why advanced ? Because it's simple and flexible, with two interesting properties.

                        Combining chapters of the book by random sampling coefficients without any coordination
                        among participating parties such as you and your friend. A good fit for decentralized systems.

                        Given your mail goes though a couple of hops, some of which are reliable and known for
                        being there when they need to be. Those reliable hops can create new ec-mails by combining
                        the ec-mails they received from their peers and redistribute new ec-mails to other peers who
                        are reading the same book, without first decoding it back to original book. This is called
                        recoding.
