                    Recently I've been attempting to view world around from p2p node's perspective
                    i.e. how can a p2p node learn about
                    global topology of network it's part of. Nodes are aware of neighbourhood
                    but not how neighbours are themselves stuctured. Node has no idea of
                    edges existing between a pair of vertices, when it's not one of those. Nodes follow one cooperative
                    protocol by forwarding messages to peers who hasn't yet seen certain message.
                    Each peer authors its own message & helps in forwarding peer-authored messages
                    while playing role of <b>hop</b>. By inspecting message body, node learns
                    of which hops has helped in forwarding certain message & pictures path in network. A few
                    of these messages, traversed through different paths, helps in forming substantial portion of network graph.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Last week I wrote about it <a class="blogLink" href="../pages/perceiving-p2p-topology.html">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In previous setting of simulation, network topologies were statically synthesized & small number
                    of participants collaborated. This week I explore more dynamically generated network
                    topologies. I also bring in libp2p based nodes into picture. Main goal is to understand
                    how to tweak the algorithm so that it can adaptively catch changes happening throughout
                    network, while keeping network wide peer specific topology probings at minimum.
                    I classify messages passed around by respective purpose. Broadly speaking, there're
                    three kinds of messages which can be sent across network.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Probe Message</li>
                    <li>Edge Add Message</li>
                    <li>Edge Remove Message</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="blogText">
                    I consider each participant of p2p network as <b>vertex</b>
                    & each TCP connection between a pair of them as an <b>edge</b>, while picturing
                    p2p overlay network as graph. P2P networks keep changing
                    their structure frequently, due to some node going down or network partition
                    occuring, which is why node's world view should be adapting to those changes.
                    I name, TCP connection being established between two peers as <b>edge added event</b>,
                    whereas disconnection of two peers triggers <b>edge removed event</b>. When either
                    of these two events happen, news is gossiped throughout network. And this allows
                    existing participants to either add or remove an edge from graph, which it's maintaining locally
                    as world view.
                    <br>
                    But some peer who has just joined network may be interested in exploring world
                    around, so it authors one probe message, which is passed throughout network collecting
                    trace of hops who cooperated in gossiping, helping every participant to refresh
                    their world view. And this is what I call, <b>probing</b>.
                    Probing helps any network participant to learn network topology
                    while it's not really necessary that everyone probes, rather single peer
                    probes & everyone learns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When announcing <b>edge added</b> event, both of peers upon which edge
                    is incident, authors their own message with <i>kind</i> set to <b>add</b>.
                    Each incident node sends message to other one, at very first step of
                    connection establishment, making other side of edge aware of self-identity.
                    After that each of them shares message with their neighbours,
                    so that it can be propagated throughout network. Before announcing, peer sets self-id
                    as other side of edge, denoting edge has been established between two peers; also
                    appends self as hop of message so that network doesn't send this message back to
                    this peer again --- reducing cost to some extent.
                </p>

                    Similarly when disconnection between two peers occur, edge removed event is propagated.
                    But this time each of those affected nodes, author their own message with kind set to <b>del</b>
                    and puts edge description in terms of ( previously ) incident node identifiers, so that when other participants receive
                    message they can delete this edge from their locally maintained view of network.

                    Probing specific crafted message carries authorship details, kind set to <b>probe</b>
                    & identifier of hops i.e. trace of path through which message has traversed. That's
                    why inspection of probe message body, helps peer in deciding whom to forward message
                    & picturing a path in network. Over time a peer receives multiple copies of same message
                    traversed via different paths, from its neighbours --- learning of existence of multiple paths in network.
                    Peers follow collaborative gossip protocol & message path is determined by trace in message body, which
                    is updated before forwarding it to next hop.

                    For running simulation, I set up <b>N</b>-many libp2p nodes, each listening for
                    incoming connections while each also attempting to establish
                    connection with <b>M</b>-many randomly chosen peers, essentially
                    forming a dynamically synthesized nework topology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During network forming step, each peer follows protocol i.e. announces
                    <i>edge added</i> message to its local neighbours, which is eventually propagated
                    throughout network, helping current network participants to learn of existence of
                    edge between a pair of nodes.
                    After network forming, one peer attempts to gauge network i.e. broadcasts
                    probe message to its neighbours, resulting into whole network learning
                    of message along with path trace, helping them to picture network structure.
                    In this step all current participants get a full picture of network.
                    To simulate link failure scenario, one randomly chosen connection
                    is dropped, which triggers <i>edge removed</i> message being broadcasted
                    to other neighbours still connected, from both of peers which just got disconnected.
                    By inspecting this message participants remove edge from graph which they
                    locally maintain as world view.
                    At the very end, randomly one connection is established, triggering propagation of
                    <i>edge added</i> message, letting peers update their world view, by adding new edge
                    in graph.

                    Randomly generated simulation setup has 7 nodes & 15 edges, where peer_1
                    probes, as a result of it everyone pictures whole world. This is how peer_1 sees
                    world around itself after running probing step.

                    Now I take a look at how peer_2 sees world around itself, after end of probing round.
                    And both of peer_1 & peer_2 find similar world view.
