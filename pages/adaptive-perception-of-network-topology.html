                    Recently I've been attempting to view world around from p2p node's perspective
                    i.e. how can a p2p node learn about
                    global topology of network it's part of. Nodes follow one cooperative
                    protocol by forwarding messages to peers who hasn't yet seen certain message.
                    Each peer authors its own message & helps in forwarding peer-authored messages
                    while playing role of <b>hop</b>. By inspecting message body, node learns
                    of which hops has helped in forwarding certain message & pictures network structure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Last week I wrote about it <a class="blogLink" href="../pages/perceiving-p2p-topology.html">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In previous setting of simulation, network topologies were statically synthetic & small number
                    of participants collaborated. This week I explore more dynamically generated network
                    topologies. I also bring in libp2p based nodes into picture. Main goal is to understand
                    how to tweak the algorithm so that it can adaptively catch changes happening throughout
                    network, while keeping network wide peer specific topology probings at minimum.
                    I classify messages passed around by respective purpose. Broadly speaking, there're
                    three kinds of messages which can be sent across network.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Probe Message</li>
                    <li>Edge Add Message</li>
                    <li>Edge Remove Message</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="blogText">
                    I consider each participant of p2p network as <b>vertex</b>
                    & each TCP connection between a pair of them as an <b>edge</b>, while picturing
                    p2p network as graph. P2P networks keep changing
                    their shape frequently, due to some node going down or network partition
                    occuring, which is why node's world view should be adapting to those changes.
                    I name, TCP connection being established between two peers as <b>edge added event</b>,
                    where as disconnection of two peers triggers <b>edge removed event</b>. When either
                    of these two events happen, news is gossiped throughout network. And this allows
                    existing participants to either add or remove an edge from graph, it's maintaining locally
                    as world view.
                    <br>
                    But some peer who has just joined network may be interested in exploring world
                    around, so it authors one message, which is passed throughout network keeping
                    trace of hops who cooperated in gossiping, helping every participant to refresh
                    their world view too. And this is what I call, <b>probing</b>.
                    Probing helps any network participant to learn network topology
                    while it's not really necessary that everyone probes, rather single peer
                    probes & everyone learns.

                    For running simulation, I set up <b>N</b>-many libp2p nodes, each listening for
                    incoming connections while each also attempting to establish
                    connection with <b>M</b>-many randomly chosen peers, essentially
                    forming a dynamically synthesized nework topology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During network forming step, each peer follows protocol i.e. announces
                    <i>edge added</i> message to its local neighbours, which is eventually propagated
                    throughout network, helping current network participants to learn of existence of
                    edge between a pair of nodes.
                    After network forming, one peer attempts to gauge network i.e. broadcasts
                    probe message to its neighbours, resulting into whole network learning
                    of message along with path trace, helping them to picture network structure.
                    In this step all current participants get a full picture of network.
                    To simulate link failure scenario, one randomly chosen connection
                    is dropped, which triggers <i>edge removed</i> message being broadcasted
                    to other neighbours still connected, from both of peers which just got disconnected.
                    By inspecting this message participants remove edge from graph which they
                    locally maintain as world view.
                    At the very end, randomly one connection is established, trigerring propagation of
                    <i>edge added</i> message, letting peers update their world view, by adding new edge
                    in graph.

                    <br>
                    Randomly generated simulation setup has 7 nodes & 14 edges, where peer_1
                    probes, as a result of it everyone pictures whole world. This is how peer_1 sees
                    world around itself.

                <p class="blogText">
                    Now I take a look at how peer_2 sees world around itself, after end of probing round.
                    And both of peer_1 & peer_2 find similar world view.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I check remaining nodes world views, I find exact similarity.

                    I plot collected metrics i.e. data transferred over each edge ( read TCP connection )
                    for collaborative probing. I see some edges carrying more data compared to others due to
                    presence of important vertices i.e. some vertex has degree 6 <i>( max possible )</i>.
