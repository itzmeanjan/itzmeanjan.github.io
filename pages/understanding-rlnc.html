                    After exploring applications, benefits & disadvantages of <b>R</b>andom <b>L</b>inear <b>N</b>etwork <b>C</b>oding,
                    I've decided to dig deeper into theory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    RLNC is a powerful construction for addressing several p2p networking problems. It can be
                    used for attaining Min Cut Max Flow capacity of underlying network graph. It can work
                    well in distributed fashion for network topologies which keep changing dynamically i.e. churn is high. Effectively
                    solving coupon collector's problem in p2p CDNs. It seems to be a good candidate for delay & disruption
                    tolerant network protocols too. There're several variations of how to code pieces. But I'm starting with
                    full network coding, where I take a whole data chunk & apply coding on all pieces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today I'll attempt to manually code a chunk of data & finally recover back original 
                    data from coded pieces, using RLNC.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've taken <span class="highlight">0xa5c3 = 0b1010_0101_1100_0011</span> as 16-bit original
                    data chunk, which I'm splitting into N<i>( = 2 )</i> equal sized pieces i.e. <span class="highlight">{0xa5, 0xc3}</span>.
                    I define each symbol to be 4-bits i.e. 1 nibble. M-many symbols together make up ( read when concatenated ) one piece. Each piece
                    has exactly M-many symbols. In total, M * N -many symbols in data chunk.
                </p>

                <p class="blogText">
                    For performing coding, I interpret each nibble as element of some <b>G</b>alois <b>F</b>ield.
                    I choose to use GF(2 ^ 4) as the extension field of prime field GF(2). In extension field GF(2 ^ 4),
                    there're 16 possible elements, each generated using following rule.
