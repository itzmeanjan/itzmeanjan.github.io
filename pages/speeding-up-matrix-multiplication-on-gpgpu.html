                    A few weeks ago I wrote one <a class="blogLink" target="_blank" href="../pages/parallel-matrix-multiplication-with-vulkan-compute.html">post</a>,
                    demonstrating parallel matrix multiplication on GPGPU using
                    Vulkan Compute API, where the speed up obtained compared to single threaded version was quite
                    substantial. But last week while working on some other problem, where matrix multiplication was
                    a necessary step, I discovered there are other ways to perform matrix multiplication, which gives
                    better speed up. These ways leverage GPGPU hardware capabilities in a better fashion, which essentially
                    speeds up this data parallel computation. Matrix multiplication itself is easily parallelizable
                    due to absence of dependencies among computational steps, which requires lesser synchronization,
                    meaning all employed threads can work on a single ( unique ) memory location, without resulting into
                    conflict ( read data races ).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today I'd like to spend sometime in explaining what I've discovered.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    In all version of matrix multiplication each cell of resulting matrix is computed
                    independently, by element-wise multiplying & summing respective row & col. If C[i, j] is being computed
                    then respective thread will read elements from A[i, ] & B[ , j] i.e. i-th row of A & j-th column of B
                    and multiply them element-wise, sum of those will be stored in C[i, j]. For square matrices of dimension N x N,
                    it'll result into 2*N-many reads from different memory locations. Each worker thread does same i.e. N*N-many worker
                    threads each to read 2*N values. Operand matrices are stored in global memory, accessing those introduces
                    high latency, resulting into slowed down computation.
                    This issue can be resolved to some extent by making use of local memory available
                    to each work group.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is how a naive matrix multiplication kernel can be written.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
    // a naive approach

    h.parallel_for(nd_range<2>{{N, N}, {B, 1}}, [=](nd_item<2> it) {
        // figure out which cell to be worked on
        const size_t r = it.get_global_id(0);
        const size_t c = it.get_global_id(1);

        // perform element-wise multiplication & keep summing
        float sum = 0.f;
        for (uint k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            sum += acc_matrix_a[r][k] * acc_matrix_b[k][c];
        }

        // store result into respective cell
        acc_matrix_c[r][c] = sum;
    });

                    Notice, when WorkGroup<sub>0</sub> computes cells (0, 0) & (0, 1), it accesses same row i.e. A<sub>0</sub>
                    twice. Similarly when cell (1, 0) & (1, 1) are computed, row A<sub>1</sub> is accessed twice, from global
                    memory. I can club some memory access of cells living in same row of resulting matrix C. I make use of
                    local memory where I store common portion of matrix_A i.e. A<sub>0</sub> while computing cell (0, 0) & (0, 1).
                    In this tiled matrix multiplication, each work group uses 1-dimensional local buffer to store tile ( read portion of cells
                    from left multiplicand matrix ). When computing cells, operands are read from local memory, which is
                    faster than global memory, resulting into speed up. But also notice, if I'm going to make use of
                    local memory, I should first make sure this local memory is filled up, before it's being used
                    as operand store. This calls for making use of barriers, which provides me with nice
                    synchronization technique among all work items of work group in execution. Using barrier, ensures
                    all work items are going to see all side effects, performed by other work items in same work group.
                    Along with memory visibility guarantee, it also gives one execution flow guarantee, where it's ensured that until all work items
                    of same work group arrive at that barrier, none will be able to proceed. After this barrier, each work item
                    can proceed with tiled cell computation. Only I need to make sure tile width properly
                    divides width of matrix i.e. N.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I notice one more thing, if I consider using 1D local buffer along with
                    2D workgroup size, it'll result into data race. If I keep using 2D workgroup size,
                    WorkGroup<sub>0</sub> computes cell (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0) & (1, 1). Now cell (0, 0) & (0, 1)
                    are interested in same row of operand matrix A, while cell (1, 0) & (1, 1) are not.
                    With 1D local buffer, work items computing cell (0, 0) & (0, 1) attempts to fill up buffer with elements of A<sub>0</sub>, whereas
                    work items (1, 0) & (1, 1) attempt to do same on same memory slice --- data race.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For avoiding this problem, I simply use 1D local buffer of width <b>B</b> along with workgroup size of (1, B), so that
                    only cells across same row are computed by work items in same workgroup --- no more data race.

    // a better approach, with local memory

                    I found, introduction of local memory buffer in matrix multiplication kernel
                    speeds up computation but it calls for more synchronization among work-items in a work-group,
                    using barrier(s). Synchronization burdens work items, lowering speedup which could be obtained
                    in absence of them. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I discovered subgroups, which can be considered subset of work-items
                    in a work-group. Subgroups provide me with powerful in-built functions, which can be applied
                    on work group itself, rather than each work item applying on self & then synchronizing using other
                    means like barrier. Notice, I'm using 1D local buffer of width B, where B work items access
                    B memory locations from local buffer --- resulting into total B*B memory accesses for each tile.
                    Let's take a look at this code snippet from last kernel.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
    ...

    // `acc_local[0]` is accessed by each of B work items, resulting into
    // B-many memory accesses of same address from different work items
    for (uint k_ = 0; k_ < B; k_++) {
        sum += acc_local[k_] * acc_matrix_b[k + k_][c];
    }

    it.barrier();

    ...
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    As I mentioned subgroup collective functions can be applied on whole subgroup, instead of each
                    individual work items, this can be leveraged for reducing B*B memory accesses for each tile to
                    only B many of those. Single work item reads memory address <span class="highlight">acc_local[i]</span>,
                    remaining (B-1)-many work items hear broadcast. Broadcast collective function gives me way to
                    avoid barriers --- substantiallly decreasing explicit synchronization cost. This approach indeed enhances computational
                    speed up obtained.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
    // another better approach with subgroup
    // collective function

        const size_t c = it.get_global_id(1);

        // l ∈ [0, B)

                    I run 3 parallel matrix multiplication implementations with 1024x1024 operand matrices, in order, on both CPU & GPGPU and obtain following result. It's clearly understandable
                    that subgroup collective function based implementation produces impressive result on GPGPU, due to in-built hardware support for low-cost synchronized
                    computation/ communication.
                    When running on CPU, I use workgroup size of B = 4, on the other hand when running on GPU, I use workgroup size of B = 32. These are
                    preferred subgroup sizes, which is implementation defined.
