                    I just discovered a gold-mine of wallpapers on this Reddit thread @ <a class="blogLink"
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/1n1r6bw/where_do_you_guys_go_for_wallpapers"
                        target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/1n1r6bw/where_do_you_guys_go_for_wallpapers/</a>.
                    I absolutely love it. So many Github repositories full of high-quality wallpapers. I downloaded many
                    of them - all for my personal collection of nice wallpapers. But I faced two problems, this writing
                    describes them, along with the solutions I came up with. And the solution involves using BLAKE3
                    cryptographic hash function.
                <ol>
                    <li>I already maintain a collection of wallpapers, though not in a very oraganized form. This time I
                        wanted to find one or more axis based on which I can organize my richer wallaper collection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More important problem was duplicate wallpapers, many popular wallpapers were appearing on
                        multiple wallpaper collector's albums, under same or different name. I wanted to get rid of
                        duplicates i.e. I wanted to build a set (think data-structure) of wallpapers - getting rid of
                        copies.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    For addressing problem (1), I decided to sort all the wallpapers I collected into one of two
                    buckets.
                    Based on form-factor of wallpaper, I decide which bucket it goes to. Formula is simple,
                    if <span class="highlight">image_width > image_height</span>, it is <b>Wide</b>,
                    else it is <b>Narrow</b>.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
# https://pypi.org/project/pillow/
from PIL import Image

def is_image_wide(image_path: str) -> bool:
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    (width, height) = img.size

    return width > height
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    The reason I decided to go with this simple bucketing technique is simply because the devices
                    where I use these wallpapers are of form-factor either wide or narrow - laptop, tablet or mobile.
                    Ease of consumption.

                <p class="blogText">
                    Problem (2) is more interesting. We can use a hash function to produce a small digest for an
                    arbirary large input string (here raw image data) and just by comparing two of those digests, we can
                    almost certainly say whether those two input images were same or not. There are so many hash
                    functions with various degrees of collision-resistance. But we want to be really sure about
                    collision-resistance, hence we go with a special class of hash-functions called cryptographic hash
                    functions. Another interesting property they possess is avalanche effect - meaning if you change
                    even a single bit of input image to a cryptographic hash function, it will produce a drastically
                    different digest. NIST has standardized many such cryptographic hash functions, but I personally
                    like BLAKE3 - a great fan of its simple yet flexible design, resulting in fast real-world
                    performance. Hence I will use BLAKE3 hash function to produce a 32 -bytes digest for each image so
                    that I can get a list of only unique wallpapers.
                    Interested to learn more about BLAKE3? Have a look at their official Github repository @ <a
                        class="blogLink" href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3"

                    Back to solving both of our problems. I've to put only unique wallpapers into either of two buckets
                    i.e. wide or narrow. Each directory in file-system works like a set data-structure, meaning no two
                    files in same directory can have same name. But many different wallpapers in my growing collection
                    of wallpapers have the same name - often they are just a decimal number.
                    I can rename all the wallpapers to their cryptographic digest (think output of running BLAKE3 hash
                    function on the content of wallpaper - raw bytes), that way each directory (which is a set
                    data-structure, provided by file-system) will only hold unique wallpapers and the issue of different
                    wallpapers having same name gets resolved.

                    Our problem should be addressed by now. All my wallpapers should be categorized into two buckets
                    (more appropriately directories), each holding only unique wallpapers, addressed by its BLAKE3
                    cryptographic digest. Addressing files by its content, more appropriately a short cryptographic
                    digest of its arbitrary large content, is known as Content Addressable Identification or CID in
                    short. Curious about CIDs? IPFS has tons of high-quality content on cryptographic digest based
                    content retrieval. One such example is <a class="blogLink"
                        href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/blob/5d7b1bbdbd63b1711dd9dcae03a8b5fb235d7aaf/docs/concepts/content-addressing.md"

                    Putting it all together, here is the Python script I wrote to sort wallpapers into either of
                    two buckets.

# HOW TO USE?

git clone https://gist.github.com/ba8ab2a8f340ff5a5107c711744ea7c7.git
pushd ba8ab2a8f340ff5a5107c711744ea7c7

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# It will create two directories in current working directory `wide` and `narrow`.
# Then it will recursively find all images (with well-known file extensions)
# in wallpaper-collection directory, put them into either bucket (actually directory), 
# while renaming each wallpaper to its corresponding BLAKE3 digest, preserving file extension.
python sort_images.py path/to/wallpaper-collection
