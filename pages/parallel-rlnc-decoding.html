                    This week I was exploring how parallelism can be incorporated into decoding of <b>R</b>andom <b>L</b>inear <b>N</b>etwork <b>C</b>odes ?
                    During decoding of RLNC coded pieces it's required to invert one N x N coding coefficient matrix, where N = #-of pieces coded together i.e.
                    generation size. And matrix inversion is quite expensive O(N ** 3), which is why I'm interested in implementing faster decoding algorithm
                    in <span class="highlight">kodr</span>, a RLNC library I've started writing sometime ago. Currently implemented decoding technique
                    works in progressive mode i.e. as soon as a new coded piece is received, decoder attempts to compute <b>R</b>educed <b>R</b>ow <b>E</b>chelon <b>F</b>orm of
                    updated matrix ( read considering new coded piece ), which keeps pieces partially decoded. When N-th linearly independent piece is received
                    last iteration of RREF calculation decodes whole data matrix & original pieces are revealed. This scheme works fine, but works in single threaded
                    mode. So I'm looking for scheme which allows leveraging multiple CPU cores while decoding pieces, which are coded with large generation size
                    ( read N is high ). As soon as generation size goes beyond 64, decoding speed starts to fall down very fast. I've found literatures around
                    parallelization of RLNC decoding which also works in progressive mode i.e. decoder doesn't need to wait for receiving all of N-many coded pieces
                    before it can start decoding those pieces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today I'll dig deep into <b>P</b>arallel <b>R</b>ole <b>D</b>ivision <b>P</b>rogressive <b>D</b>ecoding technique, proposed
                    <a class="blogLink" target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2014/974836">here</a>, which I'm already implementing
                    in <span class="highlight">kodr</span>. You may want to check implementation <a href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/kodr/pull/5" class="blogLink" target="_blank">progress</a>.

                <p class="blogText">
                    In single threaded RLNC decoding implementation, there exists only one thread of execution which accepts newly received
                    coded pieces; places coding vector into coding coefficient matrix & coded data vector into coded data matrix; reduces coefficient
                    matrix into row echelon form, also replicates respective row operations in coded data matrix. This flow of execution is followed by
                    executor thread on reception of every new coded piece. This way prograssively coded pieces get decoded. Finally reception of N-th linearly
                    independent piece reveals all original pieces, N = generation size.
                </p>

                <p class="blogText">
                    On the other hand, multi threaded variant of RLNC decoding employs more than one thread to work on coding coefficient matrix & coded
                    data matrix. Easy to reason about way of employing > 1 threads of execution, is seperately considering coding coefficient matrix & coded data matrix.
                    Say I create two threads of execution & place responsibility of mutating coding coefficient matrix on thread A, while other one replicates
                    those mutations on coded data matrix portion. As soon as a new coded piece is received, that's inspected by thread A, which primarily figures out
                    whether this piece is linearly dependent with already received pieces or not. If yes, discard piece because it doesn't bring any useful
                    information which can help in decoding. If this piece turns out to be useful one, then thread A proceeds with forward cleaning & backward substitution steps.
                    These steps are communicated to thread B, which replicates respective row operations on whole coded data matrix. So given one communication
                    channel exists between thread A & B, each of them works on two seperate portions of <span class="highlight">coded piece matrix = coded coefficient matrix + coded data matrix</span>.
                    Actions of thread B are dependent
                    on what thread A decides to do on coding coefficient matrix. But thread A doesn't necessarily need to wait for thread B to replicate respective changes,
                    rather it can proceed with newly received coded pieces & in the mean time thread B performs its pending tasks. Those elementary row operations, which thread B needs
                    to perform on coded data matrix are put in a work queue, which is periodically monitored by thread B ( read looking for new task ). Thread B runs
                    at its own pace, which is <= pace of thread A. And on reception of N-th useful piece, thread A turns whole coding coefficient matrix into N x N identity matrix &
                    enqueues respective row operations in work queue, which will be eventually executed by worker thread B --- revealing N-many original pieces.
                    This progressive way to decoding allows me to make use of multiple cores available on almost all modern machines.

                <p class="blogText">
                    Let me extend this idea of operating on coding coefficient matrix & coded data matrix with two different threads of execution and employ
                    > 1 worker threads, replicating elementary row operations on M-many non-overlapping set of columns of coded data matrix, 
                    given M-many worker threads are involved. Essentially coded data matrix is vertically splitted into M-many sub matrices of dimension K x ( piece-length / M ),
                    where K = #-of coded pieces received till now & K <= N ( = generation size ). Then M-many threads asynchronously replicate row operations
                    on non-overlapping submatrices, without using any concurrency control mechanism --- no slow down due to lock contention. Thread which works on
                    coding coefficient matrix is called supervisor thread, inspecting coding vector of newly arrived coded pieces, determining whether
                    linearly independent or not etc. . Supervisor thread performs some elementary row operations on coding coefficient matrix, which are
                    placed in worker queue in order, as those are to be replicated in coded data matrix. M-many worker threads keep listening for messages from
                    supervisor thread for new enqueued work to be replicated in respective submatrix, it's responsible for managing. Worker threads don't need to
                    synchronize their actions, they all work in their own pace --- further making model affordable. After N-many linearly independent coded pieces
                    are received, before decoded data can be consumed, it must be checked with M-many workers, whether they all have finished their pending works
                    from worker queue or not. It may happen that not all of those M-many workers are completely done with executing row operations from worker queue
                    & consumer end up reading still un-decoded data, which will be decoded in sometime future as soon as that/ those worker thread(s) complete their
                    pending worklist. It may lead to data race, which is why before decoded data can be safely consumed, supervisor must receive M-many successful completion
                    messages from M-many worker threads.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Now I'm going to demonstrate whole parallel decoding process with the help of an example. Say, generation size is 3 i.e. 3 pieces to be
                    coded together & each piece is of size 4 bytes. So decoder needs to receive 3 linearly independent coded pieces to be able successfully
                    decode original pieces. Supervisor thread works on coding coefficient matrix of dimension K x 3, where K = [1..3] & 2 worker threads
                    are responsible for managing two non-overlapping coded data submatrices, each of dimension K x 2, where K = [1..3].

                <p class="blogText">
                    After reception of every coded piece, three steps are performed in order on updated coding coefficient matrix by supervisor thread.
                    And respective steps are also replicated on coded data matrix by two worker threads.

                    When first coded piece is received, supervisor thread finds it's the only row in coding coefficient matrix, which is why step {1, 3} can't
                    be performed for this piece. Linear dependence check requires dividing row C[0] by pivot element at C[0][0] & it can be clearly understood
                    that as this is the only piece received so it's indeed useful i.e. trivial case. Resulting coding coefficient matrix looks like.
