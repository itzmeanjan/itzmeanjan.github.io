                    I was wondering <i>how can I division a chunk of binary data so that after
                    application of <b>R</b>andom <b>L</b>inear <b>N</b>etwork <b>C</b>oding
                    overhead is as low as possible ?</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For applying RLNC on a chunk of data, it needs to be splitted into smaller
                    pieces. Applying RLNC together on all of those pieces is costly when whole
                    chunk size is large, because I've to solve lots of linear system of equations
                    while decoding back to original pieces. Cost of matrix inversion is ~ O(n^3)
                    --- I don't want to spend too much time in decoding, which is why I choose to make
                    use of <i>Generation-based RLNC</i> where RLNC is only applied on pieces of
                    same generation. N-many generations form whole binary chunk. Each generation has
                    M-many pieces. And each piece has K-many symbols i.e. bytes. But passing only these
                    generation specific coded pieces doesn't help decoding process, it also needs to know
                    how exactly these pieces are combined togther, which requires encoder to also
                    share respective randomly generated coding vectors, having M-many coding coefficients.
                    Each of these coding coefficients are randomly drawn elements of <b>G</b>alois <b>F</b>ield (2**8),
                    which is a finite field with 256 elements i.e. from 0 to 255. As I can represent each byte
                    in 8-bits, GF(2**8) is a good finite field choice for performing RLNC.
                </p>
                <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/rlnc-with-ga-generation-piece-symbol.jpg">
                <p class="blogText">
                    Let's say I've 8 bytes of data, which I want to code using RLNC while splitting it into
                    pieces of length 2 bytes. So each piece has 2 symbols. I've 4 pieces, which I can code
                    at a time i.e. single generation coding. Or I may wish to pack 2 pieces together & do it
                    in two generations. Each choice comes brings a cost. When performing 2 generation coding,
                    in first generation I've to code 2 pieces, which requires me to send at least 2 linearly
                    indepedent coded pieces along with respective randomly generated coding vectors to decoder
                    process for successfully getting back original two pieces of this generation. Each coding vector
                    needs to have two GF(2**8) elements, because I'm coding two pieces together of generation 1.
                    As each random coding coefficient is of 1 byte, for each coded piece I've to send 2 * 1 = 2 bytes
                    extra. This results into 2 bytes header ( read coding vector ) + 2 bytes body ( read coded piece )
                    = 4 bytes over wire for each coded piece. As I've to send two of these linearly independent
                    coded pieces, it costs me 8 bytes of data over wire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One thing to notice here, coding coefficients are randomly drawn from GF(2**8), which might end up
                    generating linearly dependent coded pieces. Study suggests, sender needs to send 1.6 extra coded pieces
                    on average for making it fully decodable on decoder process's site. Meaning, I need to send 3.6 coded
                    pieces to decoder process, on average i.e. costing me 3.6 * 4 bytes = 14.4 bytes per generation. I've to follow
                    same process for second generation, requiring me to send total 2 * 14.4 bytes = 28.8 bytes of data to decoding
                    process over wire, for enabling it to fully decode 4 pieces of two generations. I wanted to transfer
                    8 bytes of original data, as I choose to use RLNC I'm paying with much higher data transfer cost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This time I plan to share 4 original pieces in a single generation. As I code 4 pieces together, I need
                    to have a coding vector of length 4 bytes, each coefficient randomly drawn from GF(2**8). Each coded piece
                    need to carry 4 bytes header ( reading coding vector ) + 2 bytes body ( read coded piece ) = 6 bytes
                    total. Receiver needs to get atleast 4 linearly independent coded pieces to be able to fully decode
                    into original pieces. But study says, I need 1.6 more coded pieces, resulting into 5.6 * 6 bytes = 33.6
                    bytes to be sent over wire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I could have splitted 8 bytes of original chunk into 8 pieces & applied RLNC in single generation ( read with 8 pieces )
                    or 2 generations ( read with 4 pieces in each generation ) --- which would have costed me differently. 
                    All these possible choices come at a price.
                </p>
                <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/rlnc-with-ga-cost-with-configuration.png">
                <p class="blogText">
                    Aforementioned table shows lowest possible cost is 21.6 bytes, where 8 bytes of data chunk
                    is splitted into two pieces, each of 4 bytes, which are coded together in a single generation.
                    The goal should be to choose the configuration while incurring lowest possible cost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Following diagram is another way to visualise cost with different choices. With 7 possible
                    coding choices, bytes over wire is highest ( red ) when piece count is 8 ( green ) & coded in a single
                    generation ( blue ) with no need to pad any extra bytes ( black ). My interest is choosing last point
                    in plotted diagram ( index 6 along X-axis ), where bytes over wire is lowest, piece count set to 2, generation count 1 & no extra
                    padding byte cost.

                    <br>
                    Everytime before performing coding, I can make use of algorithm for finding all possible
                    configurations of coding N-bytes original chunk & choosing the one with lowest cost. But I want to
                    find it out in a different way --- using <b>G</b>enetic <b>A</b>lgorithm.

                    My quest for finding these answers will hopefully lead me to successfully applying GA on RLNC Cost Optimization Problem & find something useful.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I already know answer to first question. My interest is in splitting whole data chunk into piece of N-bytes & grouping M-pieces
                    into generations, so that I can apply RLNC on pieces of same generation. I've to split & generate atleast two pieces to be able to apply
                    RLNC, which means if I've 8 bytes of original data, I can choose to generate 2 pieces, each of length 4-bytes. This actually allows me
                    to group <=4 bytes together & generate pieces of same length. I can choose to work with 1-byte/ 2-bytes/ 3-bytes/ 4-bytes piece size.
                    Piece size choice affects piece count & whether I need to pad any extra bytes. Extra bytes pad is needed when I choose to make each piece
                    of 3-bytes, because each piece must be of same length for applying RLNC. So extra zero bytes padding is a cost, I'd generally like to
                    avoid it as much as possible. As I know piece count, I can decide how to group pieces together to make a RLNC generation. Rule is, I must
                    have atleast 2 pieces in each generation for working with RLNC. Possible generation sizes are dependent on piece counts, while generation size
                    choice affects generation count. I've five element tuples to work with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Solution space is a set of five element tuples, each representing a possible & valid RLNC configuration.

                <p class="blogText">
                    Answer to first question, almost answered second one too. I decide to represent each chromosome as a 5-element tuple. Though
                    my interest was to represent chromosomes as binary strings, but seemingly this is what I've to work with. When defining crossover
                    & mutation operators, I'll face some problems due to this kind of chromosome representation.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Third question is already answered. I know how to calculate cost over wire ( read in terms of bytes sent ) for a given 5-element tuple i.e. RLNC
                    configuration. I use cost over wire as fitness function for each chromosome, so this is a fitness minimization problem. One thing I'm also interested
                    in --- not sending too many extra padding bytes, which is not yet considered in cost over wire calculation. In modified fitness function, 
                    I take sum of cost-over-wire & extra padding bytes.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    As I'm not working with chromosomes represented as binary strings, I can't just randomly generate a list of byte strings,
                    to be used as initial population. Rather I randomly choose N-many 5-element tuples from possible RLNC configuration set, where
                    <i>N = population size of GA</i>.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    One good thing about GA selection operator is it doesn't attempt to modify any chromosome, it just randomly chooses from
                    current population while putting more preference on chromosomes having better fitness values. And that's why I don't have to
                    devise any specific kind of selection operator. I make use of tournament selection operator with tournament size of 3.
                    Meaning if I decide to maintain population size of 20, I'll be randomly selecting 3
                    elements from current population & run a tournament on them to decide who gets to be selected to become a parent. I do another
                    round of tournament selection to find another parent & finally crossover them while respecting crossover probability.
                    That answers fifth question.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    As I mentioned before, crossover will be little problematic as I define chromosomes as 5-element tuple instead of binary strings.
                    It calls for special treatment, where two tournament selected parents to be mated for generating two children. I devise a way where I
                    place possible piece sizes in ascending sorted order in a set. As I'm working with 8-bytes whole data chunk, allowed piece sizes are
                    1-byte, 2-bytes, 3-bytes & 4-bytes. Placing them in ascending sorted order in a set gives me <span class="highlight">{1, 2, 3, 4}</span>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For first parent, say <span class="highlight">(4, 2, 0, 2, 1)</span> is individual's chromosome, I find respective piece size ( read 4 )'s index
                    in piece size set, which is 3. I randomly select one shift factor from range <span class="highlight">[0, len(piece-size-set))</span>, which I'll
                    use for shifting piece size index leftwards/ rightwards. I get shift factor 2, while I'm working with piece-size-set of length 4.
                    Now for generating first child, I randomly decide to shift first parent's piece size index ( read 3 ) leftwards by shift factor 2.
                    This gives me new shifted index <span class="highlight">( 3 - 2 ) % 4 = 1</span>. I look up piece size at index 1 of piece-size-set,
                    which is 2. Using piece size 2, I can prepare 4 pieces, because I've to split 8-bytes of whole chunk & I don't need to pad any extra zero bytes.
                    So I've 4 pieces, I can group them together in any of two possible ways.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 pieces together, resulting into 2 generations</li>
                    <li>4 pieces together, resulting into 1 generation</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="blogText">
                    I randomly choose to go with 2 pieces together, which gives me first child <span class="highlight">( 2, 4, 0, 2, 2 )</span> ---
                    a valid newly generated individual. Similarly for preparing second child, I decide to randomly shift second parent's
                    piece size index ( read 0, because second parent is <span class="highlight">(1, 8, 0, 8, 1)</span> ) leftwards/ rightwards by shift factor 2.
                    That gives me new piece size to be used in second child. As I did for first piece, same way I fill up other fields of 5-element chromosome tuple,
                    where generation size is just randomly selected from available possibilities.
