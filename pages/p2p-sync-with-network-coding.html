                    After studying <b>R</b>andom <b>L</b>inear <b>N</b>etwork <b>C</b>oding for last few weeks,
                    I've decided to make use of it for designing data syncing protocol in p2p network. Client-server
                    model works pretty well, but I can make better use of bandwidth of all participants
                    when each plays role of both client & server. Assuming a chunk of data, which is owned
                    by only one peer, has suddenly become popular. Lots of peers who has interest in that chunk
                    could directly ask the only owner for chunk --- resulting into heavy load on owner.
                    But one thing to notice, as interested peers progressively keep owning some portion of
                    chunk, they could also help others with what they have now. This way only owner doesn't end up
                    feeding all interested parties, rather interested parties also feed other interested parties.
                    This calls for decentralised coordination --- which is <i>not so easy</i>. In p2p networks,
                    piece collection is an important problem, where each interested peer tries to collect all pieces
                    of whole data chunk. Because if owner sends whole chunk as a single entity, coordination
                    is harder to define & manage, rather data chunk is splitted into multiple smaller pieces.
                    Now interested peers will attempt to collect all pieces from owner & partial owners. Duplicate
                    pieces are not helpful, every peer is looking for not-yet-seen pieces. As syncing
                    tends to reach end, peers start seeing more duplicates, which results into longer
                    sync time. Some pieces are rare, some are very rare and lots of peers attempting to collect
                    those rare pieces, resulting into <i>chaos in network</i>.
                </p>

                <p class="blogText">
                    For solving scope of rarest piece collection problem --- rather than
                    treating each piece as unique, I can combine fragments of pieces together and form whole new pieces,
                    which are not easily distinctive. From high level, it looks all pieces are more or less equally important.
                    Now peers don't collect original pieces from actual owner/ partial owners, rather they collect these
                    new pieces <i>( consisting of fragments of other pieces too )</i> and decode back to original when they've
                    collected enough useful pieces. While sharing these coded pieces, peers also share how have they combined
                    original pieces for constructing coded ones. Actually original pieces are randomly assigned some
                    coefficients/ weights i.e. pieces are added together while multiplying by respective random weights & coded pieces are formed. 
                    If there're N-many original pieces, at least N-many useful coded pieces are required for reconstructing back
                    whole chunk.

                    <br>
                    This is what RLNC does, abstractly.

                <p class="blogText">
                    I start with a byte slice i.e. <span class="highlight">[97, 110, 106, 97, 110]</span> which is owned
                    by N-many parties in p2p network. I could have asked one party to share that slice with me & I've the slice
                    now --- total N+1 owners. But I can also ask M <i>( < N )</i>-many parties to share certain portion of slice
                    with me, concurrently, expecting I get whole slice faster. The effects are clearly visible when slice size is larger.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I ask each of M-many peers to share few pieces with me, but wireless networks are unreliable inherently.
                    As my goal is reliably getting pieces as fast as possible, while transferring least possible bytes of data,
                    I decide to use coded piece distribution scheme. Each of M-many owner peers code original pieces & share coded pieces
                    with me, when I've enough of them, I decode them back to original byte slice. I can use RLNC for that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If byte slice size is large, then I've to buffer all those coded pieces & at end when enough of them are collected,
                    I attempt to decode by performing computionally expensive large matrix inversion, which costs ~ O(n^3). First issue, I can't
                    understand what I'm receiving as I receive it, rather after I receive all, I try to figure out what I've received. I want to
                    have a scheme where I can work on decoded data, as I keep receiving remaining, while still enjoying benefits of network coding.
                    Second, I don't want to perform inversion of a large matrix. For solving second issue, I decide to split whole
                    byte slice into generations & pieces of each generation are coded together i.e. there's no cross-generation
                    coding/ decoding dependency. As generations are lot smaller in size, performing small matrix's inverse is not tiresome.
                    Introducing idea of generations also decreases waiting time before decoding, to a great extent. But still for a single generation's
                    decoding, I've to wait for receiving all coded pieces of generation.

                    In following design, I'm going to consider byte slice <span class="highlight">[97, 110, 106, 97, 110]</span>
                    as single generation, with 5 pieces i.e. each piece consists of only single symbol.

                <p class="blogText">
                    My interest is in transferring this byte slice from M-many peers with as little coordination possible. The more
                    coordination, the more network traffic, the more bandwidth wastage. In plain & simple generational RLNC, randomly
                    coding coefficients are drawn from some agreed upon finite field. As coefficients are random, they need to be
                    accompanied with coded pieces for successful decoding.

                    <br>
                    As I've 5 pieces, I randomly choose 5 coefficients from <b>G</b>alois <b>F</b>ield (2**8), which has
                    256 elements & perform coding. Coded piece & coding vector, both are carried over wire to peer.

                    One way to avoid sending coding vector, which is an overhead, is pair of peers
                    agreeing upon seed, used for generating random coding coefficients. 
                    At beginning of session seed is shared & for rest of session it's used on receiver's
                    side for populating coding vectors --- now only <span class="highlight">{"coded_piece": 122}</span> sent over wire,
                    in every round of piece transfer.

                    One important goal is to avoid obtaining linearly dependent pieces ( read useless pieces ), which is sometimes result of
                    randomly drawn coding coefficients. For sake for avoiding it, I choose to use prime numbers as coding coeffients
                    in a specific way.

                    Assume I'm working on a range, where I've 6 primes which are <span class="highlight">[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]</span> & my original pieces
                    are <span class="highlight">[97, 110, 106, 97, 110]</span>. I want to code & generate 5 pieces, while using primes as coding
                    coefficients in ordered fashion, but I want to keep coordination as little as possible. I choose to use one sliding window technique,
                    where each piece's coeffients are chosen from one prime ring buffer based on selected <i>index</i>, which I call coding index. For
                    coding index <b>i</b>, start with filling coding vector's index <b>i</b> with prime number at index <b>i</b> 
                    <i>( primes are ascending ordered in ring buffer )</i>, then following indices are filled with consequtive elements
                    from ring buffer. If coding index > 0, first few remaining positions are filled in circular way
                    with consequtive primes, continuing after point where left off while populating in forward direction.

                    Actually I work on GF(2**8), having 256 elements i.e. from 0 to 255, which has 54 primes in range.

                    <span class="noteText">Rich Coded Piece :</span> A rich coded piece, is indeed rich with coding coefficients i.e. coding vector has all elements
                    set as > 1, where these elements are selected from prime ring buffer. Randomly choosing primes
                    from ring buffer & preparing coding vector works pretty well, but little structured
                    operational mode brings in lots of benefits. Coding index can be specified here too, so that
                    where to start filling coding vector with primes can be easily defined. Here I choose coding index 0
                    for rich coding, which is why I start filling coding vector at index 0 with prime at index 0 of ring buffer i.e.
                    2. For remaining places, I start rolling over while plucking consequtive primes from ring buffer. And consequtive
                    elements are 3, 5, 7, 11.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If I've to work with coding index 1 & generate coding vector for rich coding, I'll
                    fill index 1 of coding vector with prime at index 1 i.e. 3. And next places rightwards
                    are filled with 5, 7, 11. Only one place remaining i.e. index 0 of coding vector, which I fill
                    with next element of prime ring buffer i.e. 13. So, I finally prepare coding vector <span class="highlight">[13, 3, 5, 7, 11]</span>
                    while just knowing coding index <span class="highlight">1</span>.

                    Question is, how to use these piece construction techniques, so that I can decrease chance
                    of getting duplicate coded pieces. I propose one way how peers can share pieces with recipient party
                    which reduces scope of encountering duplicate pieces, even when multiple peers are acting as sender
                    while maintaining little to no coordination among them.

                    As usual, I start with an example. Say, I want to have byte slice <span class="highlight">[97, 110, 106, 97, 110]</span>
                    from 2 peers, who're having whole slice. Whole slice transfer is performed in single
                    generation.
                    I ask Peer_1 to start sending pieces from coding index 0, while using skip factor 2. I'm setting
                    skip factor 2, because I plan to connect to 2 peers & download pieces concurrently from both of them.
                    So Peer_1, shares 3 pieces with coding index <span class="highlight">[0, 2, 4]</span>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Peer_1 starts with sharing base coded piece, where all elements of coding vector are set to 1.
                    Resulting into construction of coded piece 106.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After that peer enters loop, where it prepares decodable piece, with coding index set as 0.
                    Using this coding vector, it generate one decodable coded piece 201.
                    One thing to notice, during first decodable coded piece sharing, Peer_1 hasn't shared
                    any rich piece. But in next round, it'll.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this round, coding index is 2, so coding vector is constructed by filling index 2
                    of coding vector with prime number at index 2 i.e. 5 & other elements set to 1. This coding
                    vector is used for decodable piece. Constructed coded piece is 223. But this is the round when
                    rich piece also needs to be shared, which is prepared by constructing respective coding vector
                    i.e. starting at index 2, filling up with prime at index 2 i.e. 5 & circularly filling other places
                    by drawing next primes from ring buffer. This results into rich piece 23.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This round, peer works with coding index 4, so it prepares decodable piece by putting 11 i.e. prime
                    at index 4 from prime ring buffer, at index 4 of coding vector, while filling up other places with 1.
                    Finally it results into decodable coded piece 225.

                    I propose one modification in protocol, where receiver can specify
                    whether it wants peer to send base coded piece or not. Because if it receives
                    same base coded piece from two peers, which doesn't help anyhow. Rank of decoding
                    matrix doesn't increase i.e. useless piece, no doubt.
                    Receiver sets intension of receiving base coded piece from Peer_1 only.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="blogText">
                    It's a good time to run protocol & see what happens from receiver's perspective.
                    For receiver goal is to progressively keep decoding pieces & supplying to application
                    layer with least possible delay, while keeping computional cost as low as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Receiver sees coded pieces in form <span class="highlight">( <i>coding-index</i>, <i>{base,decodable}-coded-piece</i>, <i>rich-coded-piece</i> )</span>.
                    When <i>coding-index</i> is empty, it's base coded piece at index 1 of received tuple. It should be received 
                    only once from only one peer. If <i>coding-index</i>
                    is non-empty, tuple[1] is decodable coded piece. For non-empty coding-index cases, last element of tuple
                    may be non-empty sometimes, which denotes rich coded piece. One thing to note, when rich coded
                    piece is shared, decodable one is also shared, as both of them having same coding index, it's
                    sent over-wire only once --- some saving !
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From Peer_1, first piece received is base coded piece. A base coded piece is base coded
                    because it's coding vector is simply <span class="highlight">[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]</span>.
                    So I've only <span class="highlight">[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 106]</span> in my decoding matrix.
                    Not enough for solving any equation. Then, Peer_2 shares one decodable piece with coding vector 1.
                    It denotes, it's possible to figure what's at index 1 of original piece slice, by row-reducing
                    decoding matrix. I update decoding matrix by appending <span class="highlight">[1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 182]</span>.
                    Coding vector recreation just from coding index is very easy on receiver's end, as it was
                    on sender's end.
                    Row reduction correctly reveals one element of original slice i.e. at index 1.
                    Again Peer_1 shares decodable piece with coding index 0. As coding index is 0, coding
                    vector can be formed easily i.e. <span class="highlight">[2, 1, 1, 1, 1]</span>.
                    Updating decoding matrix by appending <span class="highlight">[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 201]</span>
                    & attempting to row reduce reveals another piece i.e. at index 0 of original byte slice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Till now, receiver has received 3 linearly independent pieces from 2 peers. So it's
                    decoding matrix has rank of 3.
                    It needs at least 2 more useful pieces for completely figuring out what's whole byte slice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fortunately, Peer_2 shares both decodable & rich coded pieces with coding index 3. Reconstructing
                    coding vector for decodable piece with coding index 3 is easy i.e. <span class="highlight">[1, 1, 1, 7, 1]</span>.
                    And for rich coded piece respective coding vector is <span class="highlight">[13, 17, 19, 7, 11]</span>.
                    Appending both of these pieces into coding matrix, reveals all pieces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though receiver makes use of other pieces received later, it doesn't make any change
                    in already decoded pieces. So receiver can ask Peer_1, which shares last two pieces, to
                    not send any more pieces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Receiving party successfully decodes pieces in progressive mode, while collaborating
                    with two peers for syncing with least possible messaging overhead & also putting very
                    less computational burden on self.

                    This demonstration only shows how protocol should be working with single generation,
                    but in reality for syncing large chunks of data, it needs to work with multiple generations.
                    As data chunk is first splitted into generations & it's not a cross-generation scheme,
                    it syncs pieces of same generation from multiple peers, while also working on other generations
                    concurrently in a different session with few peers. For avoiding reception of duplicate pieces,
                    skip factor should be set optimistically. Say, when working with 3 peers for syncing data of
                    certain generation, skip factor set to 3. Now Peer_1 shares pieces with coding indices <span class="highlight">[0, 3, 6, ...]</span>,
                    when it was asked to start with coding index 0. Similarly other two peers share non-overlapping sets of pieces,
                    while only arguments shared over wire are starting coding index & skip factor. If noticed carefully,
                    I need to have (P+1)-many primes for working with P-many original pieces in a generation, while
                    not producing duplicate coded pieces. As I've 54 primes in 0 - 255 range, I can work with
                    53 pieces in a generation. So, splitting should be done while respecting this constraint.

                    It's still possible to receive few duplicate coded pieces, if some peer connection fails in mid of transfer,
                    so other peer comes into picture. Session initiation with new peer begins with same <i>( as used for failed peer )</i>
                    starting coding index & skip factor, which might result into some duplicate pieces. But it can be avoided
                    by setting starting coding index of session, to where failed peer left off.
                    Though skip factor needs to be properly set to avoid scope of receiving duplicate pieces. It stays
                    quite negligible, but still can be improved.
