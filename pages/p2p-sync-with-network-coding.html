                    After studying <b>R</b>andom <b>L</b>inear <b>N</b>etwork <b>C</b>oding for last few weeks,
                    I've decided to make use of it for designing data syncing protocol in p2p network. Client-server
                    model works pretty well, but I can make better use of bandwidth of all participants
                    when each plays role of both client & server. Assuming a chunk of data, which is owned
                    by only one peer, has suddenly become popular. Lots of peers who has interest in that chunk
                    could directly ask the only owner for chunk --- resulting into heavy load on owner.
                    But one thing to notice, as interested peers prograssively keep owning some portion of
                    chunk, they could also help others with what they have now. This way only owner doesn't end up
                    feeding all interested parties, rather interested parties also feed other interested parties.
                    This calls for decentralised coordination --- which is <i>not so easy</i>. In p2p networks,
                    piece collection is an important problem, where each interested peer tries to collect all pieces
                    of whole data chunk. Because if owner sends whole chunk as a single entity, coordination
                    is harder to define & manage, rather data chunk is splitted into multiple smaller pieces.
                    Now interested peers will attempt to collect all pieces from owner & partial owners. Duplicate
                    pieces are not helpful, every peer is looking for not-yet-seen pieces. As syncing
                    tends to reach end, peers start seeing more duplicates, which results into longer
                    sync time. Some pieces are rare, some are very rare and lots of peers attempting to collect
                    those rare pieces, resulting into <i>chaos in network</i>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One thing can be done for solving scope of rarest piece collection problem --- rather than
                    treating each piece as unique, I can combine fragments of pieces together and form whole new pieces,
                    which are not distinctive easily. From high level, it looks all pieces are more or less equally important.
                    Now peers don't collect original pieces from actual owner/ partial owners, rather they collect these
                    new pieces <i>( consisting of fragments of other pieces too )</i> and decode back to original when they've
                    collected enough useful pieces.
