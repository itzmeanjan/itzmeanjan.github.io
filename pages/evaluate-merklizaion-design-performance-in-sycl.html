                    Around a fortnight back I wrote about OpenCL accelerated Merkle Tree construction technique, while using
                    Rescue Prime Hash as underlying collision resistant, cryptographic hash function for obtaining immediate parent node from two children
                    nodes ( either leaves/ intermediates ). You can find that post <a class="blogLink" href="./opencl-accelerated-merkle-tree-construction.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During last two weeks, I've made some improvements in Rescue Prime Hash implementation and also ported it to SYCL. If you happen to
                    be specifically interested in those changes/ improvements, I suggest you take a look at following pull requests.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="blogLink" href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ff-gpu/pull/13" target="_blank">Porting vectorized OpenCL Rescue Prime to SYCL</a></li>
                    <li><a class="blogLink" href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ff-gpu/pull/16" target="_blank">Optimizing SYCL Rescue Prime with reduced vector lanes</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Along with that I also explored a different way of Merklization, where given problem statement is same as before i.e.
                    when N -many leaf nodes of some Binary Merkle Tree are provided with (N - 1) -many intermediate nodes to be computed. 
                    In this new way of Merklization, I change which work-items are tasked to compute which intermediate nodes and how many
                    kernel dispatch rounds are required for computing all intermediate nodes. But, as usual, that itself comes with its benefits and drawbacks.
                    Today in this post, I plan to study design and performance of two Merklization techniques, that I've devised, while
                    using SYCL for implementation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Same as last post, I'm not going to be explaining how I improved Rescue Prime implementation in SYCL, but I note that
                    a huge portion of Merklization performance boost comes from optimized implementation of Rescue Prime in SYCL. 
                    I'll do a deep study of that in coming weeks, as promised before.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Let me begin with simple one, which henceforth I'll call <b>merklization approach 1</b>. Here <span class="highlight">merklize</span>
                    function is provided with N -many leaf nodes, where N = 2<sup>i</sup> ∀ i ∈ {1, 2, ...}. (N - 1) -many intermediate nodes
                    are computed by dispatching compute kernel log<sub>2</sub>N times. Say for example, if I start with N = 32, all intermediates are
                    computed in 5 rounds, as shown below.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
    N = 32
    
    leaves        = [1; N] # 32 leaf nodes
    intermediates = [0; N] # empty intermediate node allocation

    ## Dispatch 1:
    intermediates[16..32] = merklize(leaves) # pairs total of 32 nodes into 16 intermediates

    ## Dispatch 2:
    intermediates[8..16] = merklize(intermediates[16..32]) # pairs total of 16 nodes into 8 intermediates

    ## Dispatch 3:
    intermediates[4..8] = merklize(intermediates[8..16]) # pairs total of 8 nodes into 4 intermediates

    ## Dispatch 4:
    intermediates[2..4] = merklize(intermediates[4..8]) # pairs total of 4 nodes into 2 intermediates

    ## Dispatch 5:
    intermediates[1..2] = merklize(intermediates[2..4]) # pairs 2 subtrees into root node

    Total intermediate nodes computed = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31 ✅
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    You should also notice, there are 5 rounds and each of them are data dependent on previous dispatch round.
                    But good news is that each of these rounds are easily parallelizable, due to absence of any intra-round 
                    data dependency. For some specific dispatch round if input to <i>merklize</i> has N intermediate/ leaf nodes,
                    each pair of consecutive nodes are read by respective work-items ( N >> 1 in total ) which are merged into single Rescue Prime digest
                    and stored in proper memory allocation. There is scope of global memory access coalescing, as non-strided, contiguous
                    memory addresses are accessed by each work-item. Let us take help of a diagram to better appreciate the scope
                    of parallelism.

                    In above diagram, N ( = 16 ) -many leaf nodes are used for depicting execution flow. It requires 4 kernel
                    dispatch rounds to compute all intermediates and each of them are data dependent on previous round. Each dispatch
                    round shows how many work-items are required to parallelly compute all computable intermediate nodes, by invoking Rescue <span class="highlight">merge</span> function;
                    which work-item accesses which pair of consequtive nodes ( either leaves/ intermediates; leaves applicable only during round 0 ).
                    Note, very first memory location ( resevered for some Rescue Prime digest ) is never accessed by any of dispatched kernels, because
                    (N - 1) -many intermediate nodes are stored in memory allocated for storing total of N -many intermediate nodes, where N is power of 2.

                    Implementing this in SYCL is pretty easy, using USM allocation allows me to perform pointer arithmetics, which is much more
                    familiar compared to SYCL buffer/ sub-buffer/ accessor. I suggest you take a look
                    <a class="blogLink" href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ff-gpu/blob/8e480571b15d747ee5747f1853781317b4e5c9ae/merkle_tree.cpp#L3-L102" target="_blank">here</a>
                    for exploring exact implementation details of <b>approach 1</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Notice when N is relatively large, say = 2<sup>24</sup>, total 24 kernel dispatch rounds will be required to compute all intermediate
                    nodes. Dispatching kernel requires host-device interaction, which is not cheap. Also OpenCL/ SYCL doesn't yet
                    allow recording commands into a buffer and then replaying same when required to be executed as I can do in Vulkan Compute; with that during actual kernel execution,
                    host-device interaction can be reduced and more work will be ready for offloading, while suffering less from host latencies due to say context switching.
                    Well, OpenCL has <a class="blogLink" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_command_buffer" target="_blank">this extension</a>
                    just to experiment with that idea, but today I'm working with SYCL. Motivated by this reason, I decided to devise a way
                    so that kernel dispatch round count can be reduced while Merklizing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm going to refer to this new Merklization technique as <b>approach 2</b>. Say we've N = 2<sup>24</sup> -many leaf nodes and we're using work-group
                    size B = 2<sup>8</sup>, then number of required kernel dispatch rounds for constructing Merkle Tree using <b>approach 2</b> will be
                    <tt>log<sub>2</sub>(N >> (2 + log<sub>2</sub>B)) + 1</tt>, which turns out to be 15, much lesser than 24, which would be required using <b>approach 1</b>.
                    Also note, it doesn't matter what is work-group size, required #-of kernel dispatch rounds will always be log<sub>2</sub>N using <b>approach 1</b>.
                    But using <b>approach 2</b>, work-group size can influence total #-of required kernel dispatch rounds to compute whole Merkle Tree.
                    If I increase work-group size B to say 2<sup>9</sup>, then following aforementioned formula, I'll be required to dispatch kernel 14 times.
                    But as per my experience, increasing work-group size to that large value benefits less, which we'll explore soon.
                    Say, finally I decide to live with work-group size B = 2<sup>6</sup>, I'll be required to perform 17 rounds of kernel dispatch, which is still lesser than
                    24 rounds, required in <b>approach 1</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've come up with following formula for computing required #-of kernel dispatch rounds using <b>approach 2</b>.
                    You should notice, an appended <tt>+ 1</tt>, in each of these cases, that's coming from <a class="blogLink" href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ff-gpu/blob/8e480571b15d747ee5747f1853781317b4e5c9ae/merkle_tree.cpp#L122-L135" target="_blank">here</a>
                    --- the very first round of kernel dispatch reads all N -many leaves from input buffer and writes (N >> 1) -many intermediate nodes
                    ( living just above leaf nodes ) in designated location of output buffer. After that remaining intermediate nodes are computed
                    in one/ many rounds. Note, each of these kernel dispatch rounds are data dependent on previous one, which is due to
                    inherent hierarchical structure of Merkle Tree.

                    Let me now explain <b>approach 2</b>, while attempting to foresee what kind of benefit it may bring to Merklization.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Say N = 16 and work-group size I'm willing to work with is 2. Then during first round, 8 work-items will be dispatched, each
                    computing single Rescue Prime merge and total 8 intermediate nodes will be produced, who lives just above leaf nodes. Following above formula,
                    I need to dispatch kernel 3 times for constructing whole Merkle Tree. First round looks like below.
                </p>
                <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/evaluate-merklization-design-performance-in-sycl-1.jpg">
                <p class="blogText">
                    During next round, which is dependent on first one, 4 work-items will be dispatched. As first step, each of these 4 work-items will be
                    computing one Rescue Prime merge, producing 4 intermediate nodes. These four work-items are globally numbered as <tt>{group: 0 => {0, 1, 2, 3}}</tt>,
                    but remember I decided to work with work-group size of 2, so local indexing of 4 work-items will be <tt>{group: 0 => {0, 1}, group: 1 => {0, 1}}</tt>.
                    After first step in round 2, all work-items present in each of work-groups are synchronized, so that it's ensured that
                    next step can be proceeded into safely, without getting into trouble of data race. After all work-items ( = 2, in number ) in work-group
                    reach <span class="highlight"><tt>sycl::group_barrier(...)</tt></span>, only even indexed work-items are chosen for computing next level of
                    intermediate nodes, which ensures odd indexed work-items are disabled and doesn't cause any data race. After all even indexed work-items
                    have computed upper level of intermediate nodes, all work-items in a work-group are synchronized again just to ensure that
                    this iteration step's data will be available ( i.e. visible to next set of active work-items ) for use in next iteration.
                    Now question is when to stop this iterative process ?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I use <span class="highlight"><tt>(1 << (iter - 1)) < B</tt></span> as iteration control condition, where <tt>iter = 1</tt> at start and then <tt>iter++</tt>
                    after each iteration completes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Going back to our example, where work-group size B = 2, <tt>iter = 1</tt> should be only iteration, as after <tt>iter++</tt>
                    stopping criteria is reached ( <tt>2 < 2 == !true</tt> ). Looking at following diagram also asserts so, only root of tree is left to
                    be computed, which will be done in last kernel dispatch round.

                    In third and last kernel dispatch round, only 1 work-item is launched for computing root of Merkle Tree and no more iterations
                    are required, because there is nothing else left for computation. Once again going back to <b>approach 2</b>, I'll demonstrate with N = 256 and B = 16
                    so that you can appreciate the need for work-group sychronization.

                    <br>
                    Formula says, 3 kernel dispatch rounds should be enough to compute all intermediate nodes of Binary Merkle Tree with 256 leaf nodes.
                    In first round, 128 work-items are dispatched for computing 128 intermediate nodes, living just above 256 leaf nodes.
                    In second kernel dispatch round, 64 work-items are dispatched for first computing 64 intermediate nodes from 128 intermediate nodes, computed
                    during last round of dispatch. Remember B = 16 is our work-group size, so 16 work-items per work-group are synchronized
                    before they decide to execute next step. As per loop control condition <tt>(1 << (iter - 1)) < B</tt>,
                    it's safe to execute loop with <tt>iter = 1</tt>. That means, 8 even indexed work-items among 16 work-items in each of 4 work-groups
                    will be activated to compute 8 intermediate nodes, producing total of <tt>8 x 4 = 32</tt> intermediate nodes from 64 intermediate nodes
                    which were computed during previous step by 4 work-groups. Let us expand into <q><i>8 even indexed work-items to be activated</i></q>.

                    only even indexed 8 work-items will participate in second step i.e. iteration with <tt>iter = 1</tt>.

                    Another reason behind stopping iteration is that I can't synchronize across work-groups, which will be required
                    in next iteration, if we've to proceed. If I decide to go with <tt>iter = 5</tt>, I need to compute 2 intermediate
                    nodes from (total) 4 intermediate nodes computed during last iteration. But those 4 input intermediate nodes are computed
                    by 4 different work-items who are part of 4 different work-groups ( see above depiction ). Question is when to start executing iteration with <tt>iter = 5</tt> ?
                    As it's not possible to synchronize across work-groups, I can't safely start executing next iteration i.e. <tt>iter = 5</tt>.
                    There's a high chance that I'll end up reading intermediate node data when it's still in undefined state.
