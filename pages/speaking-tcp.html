                    For last few months I've been working at TCP level more often than I generally do.
                    During this period I designed and implemented few systems where multiple participants
                    talk to each other over TCP while following custom application level protocol.
                    I learned the way most of TCP applications written in ( specifically ) Golang
                    can be done in a slight different way so that applications don't end up spawning one go-routine
                    per accepted connection --- resulting into thousands of active go-routines when talking to thousands
                    of concurrent peers. Rather than handling each peer in its own go-routine,
                    proactively attempting to read from socket; keeping only one socket watcher
                    go-routine which is responsible for informing any READ/ WRITE completion
                    event happening on any of delegated sockets --- consumes way lesser resources.
                    It excels at reducing scope of context switching by bringing possible
                    go-routine count to minimal. As a result of it, Golang scheduler only needs
                    to manage a few go-routines now. Previously scheduler had to orchestrate
                    thousands of go-routines on <b>N</b> system threads. I ran some experiments
                    and result was promising --- TCP servers able to easily handle <b>100k</b> concurrent connections
                    when following second approach.
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Following 3 different approaches, I develop key-value database where clients can send read/ write requests
                    over TCP. I challenge each implementation with <b>100k</b> concurrent connections
                    and collect statistics of their performance, resource consumption etc. under high load;
                    all running on a consumer-grade GNU/Linux machine in containerised environment i.e. Docker.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One go-routine per connection</li>
                    <li>One watcher for all sockets</li>
                    <li>N ( >1 ) watchers for all sockets</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="blogText">
                    The application I develop is quite simple but it captures the essence.
                    It's a remote <i>( not necessarily geographically )</i> in-memory KV database, to which clients connect
                    over TCP & maintain that connection throughout their life time. During their life time they do
                    any of two possible operations in a randomised manner.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>READ</b> - Attempt to read VALUE associated with supplied KEY</li>
                    <li><b>WRITE</b> - Attempt to associate VALUE with KEY</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="blogText">
                    In both of the cases clients expect to hear back from server. In response frame
                    VALUE associated with KEY is returned. For WRITE request, VALUE in response frame
                    must be equal to what's sent in request frame. On server side all reading/ writing
                    is done in concurrent safe manner --- by acquiring mutex locks. Only for write request
                    RWMutex lock is held i.e. <i>critical section of code</i>, otherwise normal read-only lock is held.

                    For performing desired operations, clients send structured data frames
                    over TCP; server extracts that out from socket; performs action as specified
                    in message envelope i.e. opcode field; responds back with response frame.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each message sent over wire is two-parts, where envelope carries operation kind i.e. {READ, WRITE} &
                    how many more bytes server need to be read from stream to construct a structured message. Clients
                    always expect to receive only one kind of frame in response.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Envelope - 3 bytes</li>
                    <li>Body - N ( < 65536 ) bytes</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="blogText">
                    For a READ frame, sent when client is interested in looking up VALUE associated
                    with KEY, body just holds key, preceded with key length in 1 byte field. Notice, body length
                    field in envelope is 2 bytes, allowing at max 65535 bytes of body, but in body actually
                    256 bytes can be written due to key length field in body being of 1 byte. This is done intensionally
                    for keeping illustration simple.

                    WRITE frame carries little more data, which is sent when client is interested
                    in associating VALUE with some KEY, because it carries both key, value & each of them are preceded
                    with respective length in 1 byte field. Same scene here, practically WRITE frame's body will be at max 512 bytes
                    though it's allowed to be at max 65535 bytes theoretically, as written in body length field in stream.
