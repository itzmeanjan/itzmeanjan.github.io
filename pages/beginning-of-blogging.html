            Finally I've decided to start blogging !
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              For sometime I've been procrastinating to start writing down my <i><b>thoughts, experiments & experiences</b></i>
              --- giving myself excuses of busy schedule. But being unable to do something due to lack of time is 
              most probably sign of time mis-management.
              <br>
              <br>
              So I started planning how I'm going to spend my week long time --- just as sprint planning, where I sketch
              out what're the things I'm going to do this week, with day level granularity, on each Saturday evening. After following
              this ritual for last 5 months I've discovered it's not only easy to accomodate lots of tasks in 86,400 seconds
              but also accomplish 100% if planned properly. I see this planning as an art, where there's nothing optimal, rather
              it's a gradual progression towards betterment, where failure is a friendly teacher âœ….
              <br>
              <br>
              When I started following this ritual, I used to sketch whole plan in my head. After few weeks I decided to use pencil & paper
              and was able to do better planning where I was accomplishing >90% of what I planned. 
              <br>
              <br>
              During this period, I taught myself how to wake up early morning. All it takes --- keeping alarm away
              from bed's reach, so that I'm forced to get out of bed & stop the alarm, rather than snoozing it.
              In last 5 months, I've worked on 3 large-scale production-grade open-source software systems. May be some otherday I'll
              talk about them. Reading more blogs; listening to podcasts; reading books are among the things
              I've become better at doing. I've seen improvement in the way I manage my tasks at workspace --- completing more
              good quality tasks in lesser timespan. Empowered by better time management, I've seen improvement
              in my relationship with other human beings & nature ( it's important ðŸ˜‰ ).
              <br>
              <br>
              But more important part is understanding that, scheduling is an art --- where everyday collecting
              feedback; accumulating them over week & on Saturday evening sitting down for making a better
              plan --- is an infinite loop.
              <br>
          </p>
          <div class="microlight"> start;

 while(True) {
  while(not saturday) {
    follow;
    collect-feedback;
  }

  learn;
  incorporate;
 }</div>
            <p class="blogText">
              I noticed getting inside infinite loop is hard, but once you're in, it's beautiful here ðŸ¥°.
              I'd speak from my heart, as I'm writing this, I feel writing is indeed impactful.
              <br>
              <br>
              Have a great time !
