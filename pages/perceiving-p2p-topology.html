                    Perceiving P2P Network Topology

                <p class="blogText">
                    I asked, <b>how does the world look like from p2p node's perspective ?</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I decorated one experiment so that I can view world from a p2p node's perspective. First I'd like
                    to clarify what I mean by world view. A p2p network is a graph i.e. a mathematical structure
                    which I write as G = (V, E); useful when representing relationship between few entities. I represent
                    those entities as V i.e. vertex/ node set. Elements of V are connected via edges --- V x V âˆˆ E. 
                    In p2p network set up, an entity is some process & connection between two of them is ( say ) TCP,
                    using which two processes carry out meaningful conversation. TCP being bidirectional, reliable, streaming
                    protocol, network is undirected graph though each data flow has direction associated. Each process ( read p2p node ) 
                    runs two I/O subprocesses for each peer it maintains a connection to --- one for reading messages
                    sent by peer, other one for sending messages to peer. One peer always knows it's neighbourhood i.e. which
                    nodes it's directly connected to, but may not see whole picture of network it's part of. A p2p network can
                    have N ( > 0 ) participants where each participant may know M-many others directly, where M < N. For gaining
                    a global view of network i.e. not only to whom node itself is connected to, but also how are other network participants
                    helping in structuring network topology, nodes need to follow certain protocol. The protocol requires participant to forward
                    messages to a subset of others it's directly connected, where messages are received from neighbours. 
                    Message sending is no doubt costly, sending as less as possible is the goal.
                    How much data to be sent over wire while following protocol, is influenced by degree of nodes i.e. how many connections
                    each peer maintains with other nodes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I design one protocol that each participant process follows, where synthetic network topology is imposed
                    on participants, for running simulation. Afterwards I analyse collected log for viewing world around
                    from each network participant's eyes, while inspecting price paid for constructing view i.e. in terms of bytes of data
                    carried over wire while following protocol.

        if author(msg) == self:

                    Each network participant is identified uniquely & authors one uniquely identifiable message. It propagates that
                    to all peers it's directly connected to. On reception of message from other peer, it first inspects message
                    for absence of any of its directly connected peer's ids. If found any, forwards message to them, while appending
                    unique self id in hop field, which will be again inspected in respective recepient node. If peer authored
                    message is received again, it's not forwarded to any. Protocol ends in finite time due to two termination properties,
                    though no time limit is provided, due to asynchronous nature of message passing.

                    I create one setup with 3 nodes, where each node follows aforementioned protocol. Each node maintains
                    connections with other 2 peers i.e. satisfying criteria for forming both <b>Cycle</b> & <b>Mesh</b> topology.

                    In first step each peer propagates its authored message to others. I denote messages with <i>Message i</i>, where 0 <= i < N ( = 3 ).

                    Peer keeps receiving messages from others; learns about who is connected to whom directly; helps

                    each step, <i>as marked in above flow diagram</i>, peer has a better picture of network.
                    I try to find out what messages each peer is keeping track of.

                    At very beginning, each peer knows about its local neighbourhood i.e. peer 0 knows
                    it's directly connected to peer (1,2). But it has no idea whether peer 1 & peer 2
                    are also neighbours or not. For learning that peer 0, has to wait until in step 5 it
                    receives <i>Message 1,2</i> from its neighbour peer 2. Following protocol it inspects
                    message & figures out this message is authored by peer 1 & has hopped to it via peer 2. Then it's
                    evident peer 1 & peer 2 are neighbours. But notice after that, peer 0 doesn't forward <i>Message 1,2</i>
                    to any of else, due to presence of both neighbouring peer ids in hop field of message.
                    While in step 6, peer 0 forwarded <i>Message 1</i> to peer 2, as <i>Message 1,0</i> because header
                    inspection found this message has not yet hopped via peer 2.

                    <br>
                    Similarly peer 1 learns peer 0 & peer 2 are neighbours in step 2, while peer 2 starts seeing full
                    picture in step 3. Picture becomes clearer when peer 0 receives <i>Message 2,1</i> from peer 1 in step 8,
                    asserting its belief that indeed peer 1 & peer 2 are neighbours connected via undirected edge ( read bidirectional TCP connection ).

                    Now I spend some time in imposing synthetic network topology, for running simulation & collecting data. I start with

                    I take 5 nodes i.e. 10 edges across which data flows in either direction.

                    topology, so discovering them all requires flowing message through them, costing more data transfer. 
                    With 10 edges, total cost incurred by network for following protocol is quite high.

                    Total 3148 bytes of data peer 4 received & sent to its neighbours while following protocol. 
                    But when I look at how much peer 4 had to spend, in case of circular network topology,
                    it's only 208 bytes.

                    <br>
                    Finally I decide to impose another topology, shaped like starfish. After orchestrating connection
                    between peers, I let them run protocol. Starfish topology is cycle network in disguise, just that
                    it's drawn in different way. I want to understand does changing peer connections little bit, 
                    make any difference in node's perception of outer world.

                    Cost incurred by network, while following protocol, in starfish topology is similar to what I found
                    in circular network topology. Each edge helps in transferring 208 bytes of data.

                    I reconstruct network from message log, for understanding how peer 3 views world around itself. And it's evident
                    it's view is correct, while cost incurred is same as cycle network topology.

                    I note, cost can be reduced, because for simulation I decided to encode messages as JSON
                    which is text based serialisation technique, binary data serialiser should be preferred
                    choice in real-world scenario. Code used for designing, running simulation, collecting log &
                    visualising results, can be found <a class="blogLink" href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/p2p">here</a>.

                    I ask,
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does having knowledge of network topology really helpful ?</li>
                    <li>Can it be used for making better routing/ content discovery decisions ?</li>
                    <li>Can it be exploited in maintaining better stability in network, given p2p networks are dynamic in nature so topology keeps changing ?</li>
                    <li>At what cost network dynamics can be captured by participants ?</li>
                    <li>How often chit-chat needs to happen for making learning a continuous goal for peers ?</li>
                    <li>Using network topology knowledge, can newjoiners be placed in network such that desired topology is maintained in colloborative fashion ?</li>
                    <li>How does it all fit together in a large & complex network topology, which I see in IPFS or any public Blockchain ?</li>
                    <li>How things look like when adverseries come into picture ?</li>
