                    Perceiving P2P Network Topology

                    I asked, <b>how does the world look like from p2p node's perspective ?</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I decorated one experiment so that I can view world from a p2p node's perspective. First I'd like
                    to clarify what I mean by world view. A p2p network is a graph i.e. a mathematical structure
                    which I write as G; useful when representing relationship between few entities. I represent
                    those entities as V i.e. vertex/ node set. Elements of V are connected via some edges --- V x V âˆˆ E. 
                    In p2p network set up, an entity is some process & connection between two of them is ( say ) TCP,
                    using which two processes perform some meaningful conversation. TCP being bidirectional, reliable, streaming
                    protocol, network is undirected graph though each data flow has direction associated. Each process ( read p2p node ) 
                    runs two I/O subprocesses for each peer it maintains a connection to --- one for reading messages
                    sent by peer, other one for sending messages to peer. One peer always knows it's neighbourhood i.e. which
                    nodes it's directly connected to, but may not see whole picture of network it's a part of. A p2p network can
                    have N ( > 0 ) participants where each participant may know M-many others directly, where M < N. For gaining
                    a global view of network i.e. not only to whom node itself is connected to, but also how are other network participants
                    helping in structuring network topology, nodes need to follow certain protocol. The protocol requires participant to send
                    messages to others it's directly connected to. Message sending is no doubt costly, sending as less as possible is the goal.
                    How much data to be sent over wire while following protocol, is influenced by degree of nodes i.e. how many connections
                    each peer maintains with other nodes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I design one protocol which each participant process follows, where synthetic network topology is imposed
                    on participants, while running simulations. Afterwards I analyse collected log for viewing world around
                    from each network participant's telescope, while inspecting price paid for it i.e. in terms of bytes of data
                    carried over wire while following protocol.
