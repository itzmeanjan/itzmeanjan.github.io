            Sometime ago I started working on <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Fast, Light-weight, Ordered Pub/Sub
            System</span> --- built on top of async I/O, leveraging power of kernel event loop.
            <br>
            The main idea behind it was to write a software ( along with SDK ) which can be used for publishing arbitrary length messages to N-many
            topics; subscribing to N-many topics -- listening for messages published on each of them; and last but not least
            one powerful Pub/Sub Hub ( i.e. Router ) which will easily solve C10K by leveraging power of async I/O.
            <br>
            <br>
            The aforementioned problem statement is solved, which is why I decided to update problem statement.
            Now it looks like <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Distributed, Fast, Light-weight, Ordered Pub/Sub System</span> --- solving
            C1M easily while leveraging power of kernel event loop & p2p networking.
            <br>
            <br>
            By making <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> distributed, I get to handle 1M concurrent connection
            where nodes form a mesh network for chatting about topic interest(s) & forward messages when need to.
            I choose to use <span class="highlight">libp2p</span> for networking purpose, for being so modular --- enabling easy horizontal
            scalability, while taking care of stream multiplexing, security, peer-discovery etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here I propose primary design of system !
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              Multiple <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> nodes can discover each other using DHT ( distributed hash table )
              powered peer discovery mechanism, built right into <span class="highlight">libp2p</span>
              and eventually form a mesh network. If network has N participant(s), each participant is going to maintain
              connection with other N-1 peer(s), where N > 0. These participants of p2p network are going to chat with each
              other over bi-directional stream. Things nodes need to talk about ðŸ‘‡
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Topic subscription ( also ACK )</li>
              <li>Topic unsubscription ( also ACK )</li>
              <li>Message forwarding</li>
              <li>Periodic heartbeat</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="blogText">
              As each of aforementioned operations require to pass different message formats, I'm going to define
              respective wire format. But before I get into wire format, writing to stream, reading from stream
              I'd like to spend some time in going through high level overview of network operation.

          <p class="blogText">
              Say, two nodes form a cluster --- one node has a <i>topic_1</i> subscriber connected to it while
              other one has a publisher connected to it, willing to publish message on <i>topic_1</i>. After
              first node finds out, it has one subscriber interested in messages from <i>topic_1</i>, it decides
              to ask its peer <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node, if it sees any message targetted to
              <i>topic_1</i>, it should inform requester. Publisher sends publish intent to network, which triggers
              event saying network has received some message on <i>topic_1</i> for which first node has interested subscriber.
              Two nodes will chat over p2p network, resulting into message forwarding, which will enable first node
              to deliver message published on <i>topic_1</i> to its subscriber.
              <br>
              <br>
              When noticed carefully, network follows certain protocols
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>When subscriber shows interest in <i>topic_1</i>, it needs to be broadcast to peers</li>
              <li>When publisher publishes message on <i>topic_1</i> & node finds some peer showed interest
                in this topic, it'll forward that message to that peer</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              Let's take another scenario.
          </p>
          <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/pub0sub-high-level-arch-3.jpg">
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              Continuing previous scenario, after sometime subscriber doesn't anymore want to receive
              messages published on <i>topic_1</i>, so it sends unsubscription intent to network. As a result
              of it, this node decides to broadcast same to network, because it found it doesn't have any other
              subscriber who're interested in messages of <i>topic_1</i>. All peers who kept record of this node
              being interested in <i>topic_1</i>, updates their respective interest table, ensuring when in future
              it receives message published on <i>topic_1</i>, it won't forward to first peer.
              <br>
              <br>
              This way of showing interest to topics when peers has some subscribers to feed or 
              announcing not interested anymore when all subscribers of certain topic unsubscribes --- allows
              network to pass messages only when needed, eventually consuming lower bandwidth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                With more peers, network interaction may look like ðŸ‘‡ from high level
            </p>
            <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/pub0sub-high-level-arch-1.jpg">
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                Say, one subscriber shows interest in receiving messages from <i>{topic_1, topic_2, topic_3}</i>
                but the <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node it's connected to doesn't have any publisher
                of any of those topics. As soon as <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node learns it has subscriber to feed messages of 
                <i>{topic_1, topic_2, topic_3}</i>, following protocol it announces that intent to other peers.
                Each of other peers record it & as soon as it receives any message published on any of these topics
                it forwards those to respective peers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                I'll now spend some time in specifying wire-format of messages exchanged between peers.
            </p>
            <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/pub0sub-high-level-arch-4.jpg">
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                Each message exchanged between peers over p2p layer, needs to have two parts
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Header ( 5 bytes )</li>
                <li>Body ( N bytes )</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="blogText">
                Just by reading header part receiver must be able to understand two things
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What kind of operation is it ?</li>
                <li>How many more bytes to read from stream for consuming message body ?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="blogText">
                First question can be answered by checking very first byte of message. Each operation
                is denoted by unique opcode. There're 255 possible opcodes, though only 6 of them are in use as of now.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heartbeat : <b>1</b></li>
                <li>Topic subscription : <b>2</b></li>
                <li>Topic subscription ACK : <b>3</b></li>
                <li>Topic unsubscription : <b>4</b></li>
                <li>Topic unsubscription ACK : <b>5</b></li>
                <li>Message Forward : <b>6</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blogText">
                By reading next 4 bytes receiver understands how many more bytes it should now read from stream
                so that it can successfully deserialise message, depending upon opcode. Each opcode denotes different
                message wire-format, resulting into different deserialisation logic upon reception.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a very high level wire-format, which is applicable for each of messages. But I'd like
                to define how <b>BODY</b> of message is serialised/ deserialised for different opcodes. Starting with
                how it looks like when announcing interest of listening to some topics.
            </p>
            <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/pub0sub-high-level-arch-5.jpg">
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                Note, above image is nothing but magnification of message <b>BODY</b> when opcode âˆˆ {2, 4}. Requirement
                is peer needs to announce it wants to receive all messages published on topics, because it has
                some subscribers interested in those. Receiver side when reading from stream, knows how many
                bytes it needs to read from stream for completely consuming <b>BODY</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                It starts by reading first 1-byte, where it has instruction encoded how many next bytes it should
                read for making one meaningful topic name. Now it has either consumed all bytes of <b>BODY</b>
                or some of them are left. If left, it'll again consume 1-byte, carrying instruction for it for
                figuring out what's new topic name. This way, it'll keep reading until it has exhausted all bytes
                of <b>BODY</b>. By the end it must have successfully constructed structured object in respective
                environment, containing topics some peer want to get notified of.
                <br>
                <br>
                Similar wire-format is followed for serialising <b>BODY</b> when announcing lack of interest in some topics.
                <br>
                <br>
                Both of aforementioned opcodes, expect to hear back with ACK messages i.e. opcode âˆˆ {3, 5}, where
                <b>BODY</b> can be encoded by putting binary value denoting success/ failure.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally I'll cover how to serialise/ deserialise forwarded message to/ from stream.
