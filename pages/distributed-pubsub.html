            Sometime ago I started working on <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Fast, Light-weight, Ordered Pub/Sub
            System</span> --- built on top of async I/O, leveraging power of kernel event loop.
            <br>
            The main idea behind it was to write a software ( along with SDK ) which can be used for publishing arbitrary length messages to N-many
            topics; subscribing to N-many topics -- listening for messages published on each of them; and last but not least
            one powerful Pub/Sub Hub ( i.e. Router ) which will easily solve C10K by leveraging power of async I/O.
            <br>
            <br>
            The aforementioned problem statement is solved, which is why I decided to update problem statement.
            Now it looks like <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Distributed, Fast, Light-weight, Ordered Pub/Sub System</span> --- solving
            C1M easily while leveraging power of kernel event loop & p2p networking.
            <br>
            <br>
            By making <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> distributed, I get to handle 1M concurrent connection
            where nodes form a mesh network for chatting about topic interest(s) & forward messages when need to.
            I choose to use <span class="highlight">libp2p</span> for networking purpose, for being so modular --- enabling easy horizontal
            scalability, while taking care of stream multiplexing, security, peer-discovery etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here I propose primary design of system !
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              Multiple <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> nodes can discover each other using DHT ( distributed hash table )
              powered peer discovery mechanism, built right into <span class="highlight">libp2p</span>
              and eventually form a mesh network. If network has N participant(s), each participant is going to maintain
              connection with other N-1 peer(s), where N > 0. These participants of p2p network are going to chat with each
              other over bi-directional stream. Things nodes need to talk about ðŸ‘‡
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Topic subscription ( also ACK )</li>
              <li>Topic unsubscription ( also ACK )</li>
              <li>Message forwarding</li>
              <li>Periodic heartbeat</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="blogText">
              As each of aforementioned operations require to pass different message formats, I'm going to define
              respective wire format. But before I get into wire format, writing to stream, reading from stream
              I'd like to spend some time in going through high level overview of network operation.

          <p class="blogText">
              Say, two nodes form a cluster --- one node has a <i>topic_1</i> subscriber connected to it while
              other one has a publisher connected to it, willing to publish message on <i>topic_1</i>. After
              first node finds out, it has one subscriber interested in messages from <i>topic_1</i>, it decides
              to ask its peer <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node, if it sees any message targetted to
              <i>topic_1</i>, it should inform requester. Publisher sends publish intent to network, which triggers
              event saying network has received some message on <i>topic_1</i> for which first node has interested subscriber.
              Two nodes will chat over p2p network, resulting into message forwarding, which will enable first node
              to deliver message published on <i>topic_1</i> to its subscriber.
              <br>
              <br>
              When noticed carefully, network follows certain protocols
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>When subscriber shows interest in <i>topic_1</i>, it needs to be broadcast to peers</li>
              <li>When publisher publishes message on <i>topic_1</i> & node finds some peer showed interest
                in this topic, it'll forward that message to that peer</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              Let's take another scenario.
          </p>
          <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/pub0sub-high-level-arch-3.jpg">
          <br>
          <p class="blogText">
              Continuing previous scenario, after sometime subscriber doesn't anymore want to receive
              messages published on <i>topic_1</i>, so it sends unsubscription intent to network. As a result
              of it, this node decides to broadcast same to network, because it found it doesn't have any other
              subscriber who're interested in messages of <i>topic_1</i>. All peers who kept record of this node
              being interested in <i>topic_1</i>, updates their respective interest table, ensuring when in future
              it receives message published on <i>topic_1</i>, it won't forward to first peer.
              <br>
              <br>
              This way of showing interest to topics when peers has some subscribers to feed or 
              announcing not interested anymore when all subscribers of certain topic unsubscribes --- allows
              network to pass messages only when needed, eventually consuming lower bandwidth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                With more peers, network interaction may look like ðŸ‘‡ from high level
            </p>
            <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/pub0sub-high-level-arch-1.jpg">
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                Say, one subscriber shows interest in receiving messages from <i>{topic_1, topic_2, topic_3}</i>
                but the <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node it's connected to doesn't have any publisher
                of any of those topics. As soon as <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node learns it has subscriber to feed messages of 
                <i>{topic_1, topic_2, topic_3}</i>, following protocol it announces that intent to other peers.
                Each of other peers record it & as soon as it receives any message published on any of these topics
                it forwards those to respective peers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="blogText">
                I'll now spend some time in specifying wire-format of messages exchanged between peers.
