                    Sometime ago I started working on <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Fast, Light-weight, Ordered
                        Pub/Sub
                        System</span> --- built on top of async I/O, leveraging power of kernel event loop.
                    <br>
                    The main idea behind it was to write a software ( along with SDK ) which can be used for publishing
                    arbitrary length binary messages to N-many
                    topics; subscribing to N-many topics --- listening for messages published on each of them; and last
                    but not least
                    one powerful Pub/Sub Hub ( i.e. Router ) which will easily solve C10K by leveraging power of async
                    I/O.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The aforementioned problem statement is solved, which is why I decided to update problem statement.
                    Now it looks like <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Distributed, Fast, Light-weight, Ordered Pub/Sub
                        System</span> --- solving
                    C1M easily while leveraging power of kernel event loop & p2p networking.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By making <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> distributed, I get to handle 1M concurrent
                    connection
                    where nodes form a mesh network for chatting about topic interest(s) & forward messages when need to
                    --- a collaborative effort among peers.
                    I choose to use <span class="highlight">libp2p</span> for networking purpose, for being so modular
                    --- enabling easy horizontal
                    scalability, while taking care of stream multiplexing, security, peer-discovery etc.

                    Multiple <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> nodes can discover & connect to each other using DHT

                    powered peer discovery mechanism, built right into <span class="highlight">libp2p</span>
                    and eventually form a mesh network. If network has N participant(s), each participant is going to
                    maintain
                    connection with other N-1 peer(s), where N > 0. These participants of p2p network are going to chat
                    with each
                    other over bi-directional stream. Things nodes need to talk about ðŸ‘‡

                    As each of aforementioned operations require to pass different message formats, I'm going to define

                    I'd like to spend some time in going through high level overview of network operation.

                    Say, two nodes form a cluster --- one node has a <i>topic_1</i> subscriber connected to it while
                    other one has a publisher connected to it, willing to publish message on <i>topic_1</i>. After
                    first node finds out, it has one subscriber interested in messages from <i>topic_1</i>, it decides
                    to ask its peer <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node, if it sees any message targeted to
                    <i>topic_1</i>, it should inform requester. Publisher sends publish intent to network, which
                    triggers
                    event saying network has received some message on <i>topic_1</i> for which first node has interested
                    subscriber.
                    Two nodes chat over p2p network, resulting into message forwarding, which enables first node
                    to deliver message published on <i>topic_1</i> to its subscriber.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When noticed carefully, network follows certain protocols
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When subscriber shows interest in <i>topic_1</i>, <span class="highlight">0hub</span> broadcasts it to peers</li>
                    <li>When publisher publishes message on <i>topic_1</i>, <span class="highlight">0hub</span> forwards message to all interested peers</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Let's take another scenario.

                <p class="blogText">
                    Continuing previous scenario, after sometime subscriber doesn't anymore want to receive
                    messages published on <i>topic_1</i>, so it sends unsubscription intent to network. As a result
                    of it, respective <span class="highlight">0hub</span> node decides to broadcast same to network, because it found it doesn't have any other
                    subscribers who're interested in messages of <i>topic_1</i>. All peers who kept record of this node
                    being interested in <i>topic_1</i>, updates their respective interest table, ensuring when in future
                    it receives message published on <i>topic_1</i>, it won't forward to first peer.

                    <br>
                    This way of showing interest to topics when peers has some subscribers to feed or
                    announcing not interested anymore when all subscribers of certain topic unsubscribes --- allows
                    network to pass published messages only when needed, eventually consuming lower bandwidth. I call it <b>Lazy
                        Pushing</b>.

                    Each of other peers record it & as soon as they receive any message published on any of these topics

                    By reading next 4 bytes from header, receiver understands how many more bytes it should read from stream
                    so that it can successfully deserialise message, depending upon opcode. Each opcode denotes
                    different
                    message wire-format, resulting into invocation of different deserialisation logic upon reception.

                    Above is a high level wire-format, which is applicable for each of messages. But I'd like
                    to define how <b>BODY</b> of message is serialised/ deserialised for different opcodes. Starting
                    with
                    how it looks like when announcing interest in listening to some topics.

                    Note, above image is nothing but magnification of message <b>BODY</b> when opcode âˆˆ {2, 4}.
                    Requirement
                    is peer needs to announce it wants to receive all messages published on topics, because it has
                    some subscribers interested in those. Receiver side when reading from stream, knows how many
                    bytes it needs to read from stream for completely consuming <b>BODY</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It starts by reading first 1-byte, where it has instruction encoded how many next bytes it should
                    read for making one meaningful topic name. Now it has either consumed all bytes of <b>BODY</b>
                    or some of them are left. If left, it'll again consume 1-byte, carrying instruction for it for
                    figuring out what's next topic name. This way, it'll keep reading until it has exhausted all bytes
                    of <b>BODY</b>. By the end it must have successfully constructed structured object in respective
                    environment, containing topics some peer want to get notified of.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Similar wire-format is followed for serialising <b>BODY</b> when announcing lack of interest in some
                    topics.

                    <br>
                    Both of aforementioned opcodes, expect to hear back with ACK messages i.e. opcode âˆˆ {3, 5}, where
                    <b>BODY</b> can be encoded by putting binary value denoting success/ failure. These are expected to
                    be received with in a stipulated time window after interest ( opcode 2 ) / lack of interest ( opcode
                    4 ) message is sent to peer. If not
                    received, for opcode 2, it'll be resent upto N-times. If still not received, it results into
                    connection termination
                    with peer for not following protocol.

                    But if peer is waiting for ACK of message with opcode 4, it doesn't resend, because of being low
                    priority. Of course
                    it might result into network wasting some bandwidth for passing some published message which could have been
                    avoided. If any forwarded message
                    from any topic to which peer is not interested in, is received even after lack of interest message
                    was broadcast ( opcode 4 )
                    it can be ignored by receiver. Receiving peer also sends another message to respective peer with
                    opcode 4, stating it's
                    not interested in these topics --- just like repeating self. This is done so that next time network can save some bandwidth.

                    Finally I'll cover how to serialise/ deserialise forwarded message to/ from stream.

                    Start by reading first byte of <b>BODY</b>, which encodes how many topics this message is being
                    targeted to.
                    A message can be targeted to 255 topics at max. Receiver knows how many topics it should be reading
                    from stream.
                    So it starts by reading next 1 byte, encoding first topic's byte length. It knows how many next
                    bytes to be read
                    for figuring out first topic name. It has just read one topic name. Similarly it'll continue reading
                    more topic names
                    until all are read off. After N topic names are read, it'll read 4 bytes, encoding how many next
                    bytes it needs to
                    read for extracting out actual message content.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually it'll reach end, constructing structured data by consuming stream. This is how forwarded
                    messages
                    are recovered from stream by some peer who showed interest in getting notified when some message is
                    published
                    on topics of interest. After getting structured data, receipient <span class="highlight">0hub</span>
                    node can
                    send message to subscribers connected to it directly, interested in any of topics this message is
                    published on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Reader may notice</b>, a slight difference in encoding variable number topic list, between
                    previous two diagrams.
                    When encoding to be forwarded message ( opcode 6 ), peer encodes topic count in first 1-byte of
                    <b>BODY</b> part of message.
                    This is required, otherwise during deserialisation receiver won't be able to understand where in
                    stream it should stop
                    reading topic names & start reading 4-byte lengthy actual message content's length field.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But same is not required for message sent with opcode âˆˆ {2, 4}, because there's nothing more to read
                    after topic name list
                    and receiver already knows length of <b>BODY</b> part of message, so it knows how long to read from
                    stream.
