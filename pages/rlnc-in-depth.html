                <p class="blogText">
                    Last week I spent some time going through encoding, decoding process in <b>R</b>andom <b>L</b>inear <b>N</b>etwork <b>C</b>oding,
                    this week I was exploring recoding part of RLNC, which is seemingly more interesting
                    because other block coding/ rateless coding techniques don't possess it.
                    One of the good parts of RLNC is it can provide <b>F</b>orward <b>E</b>rror <b>C</b>orrection
                    not only in point-to-point manner, but also in a fully distributed setup. The <i><b>R</b>andom</i> part
                    of RLNC denotes coding vector creation is more flexible, while still being equally ( if not more ) performant.
                    Each peer can randomly draw coefficients without any need of coordination & code original pieces/
                    recode already coded pieces ( received from some other peer ) into newly coded pieces, which can be distributed to next hops
                    who may again recode if needed, while coded pieces still staying decodable as long as
                    enough number of linearly independent pieces are found. RLNC allows flexible generation size
                    choice i.e. how many pieces to code together is easily configurable. And it enables usage
                    of sliding window technique while coding pieces. RLNC is able to
                    effectively solve p2p file sharing system's <i>rarest piece selection problem</i> to a great
                    extent, because each piece is quite equally important to peers interested in collecting all pieces
                    for constructing whole file.
                    Source peer can spread N-many original pieces along with few coded pieces throughout network
                    & may leave. Other peers can create more coded pieces using any combination of
                    coded/ uncoded pieces available to it. After sometime when some new peer is interested in
                    constructing whole file, it'll simply collect minimum N-many useful pieces from any peers.
                    As long as collected pieces together encompass all original pieces, data is fully constructable.
                    RLNC provides with some level of inherent security because if atleast N-many pieces
                    are not available, data can't be decoded. Though I don't think it's something to be relied on
                    always, due to presence of flexible generation based RLNC techniques, where it's possible to decode from
                    stream of data i.e. not waiting for all pieces to arrive & then decode.
                    One problem with RLNC is, while some peer only attempting to collect useful pieces neighbours might endup
                    sending linearly dependent pieces ( read <i>useless pieces</i> ), because they don't know what's available with peer.
                    In these scenarios, some sort of protocol level coordination is required for letting neighbours know what's
                    available & what peer is looking for. If this kind of coordination is not used from protocol level
                    peers might be doing unnecesary coding/ recoding which can be avoided. These coordinations also
                    help peers in constructing whole piece faster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'll dig deep into coding, decoding & recoding for full RLNC scheme, where I take a byte slice;
                    generate coded pieces, which are recoded & newly coded pieces are made available; some useful pieces are collected
                    from set of all available pieces for attempting decoding into original byte slice. 
                    I also explain, <i>how to choose <b>useful</b> pieces ?</i>
                </p>
                <p class="blogText">
                    I start by taking a byte array i.e. <span class="highlight">[97, 110, 106, 97, 110]</span>, which I plan to code. For coding using RLNC, I need
                    to fix one finite field from where I'll be drawing elements at random i.e. coding coefficients.
                    As each element of byte array can be represented using 8-bits <i>( max possible byte 255 )</i>,
                    I choose <b>G</b>alois <b>F</b>ield 2**8, which also has 256 elements <i>( from 0 to 255 )</i>.
                    GF(2**8) is an extension of prime field GF(2). All arithmetic operations
                    in this finite field i.e. addition & multiplication result into element of same field. 
                    I intensionally skipped subtraction & division, because they're addition & multiplication in disguise, respectively. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I choose <span class="highlight">x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1</span>
                    as irreducible polynomial, which behaves like a prime number i.e. has only 1 & self as factors.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
 $ python3
 >>> import galois
 >>> gf256 = galois.GF(2 ** 8) # extension field
 >>> irr = gf256.irreducible_poly
 >>> irr
 Poly(x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1, GF(2)) # default irreducible polynomial for field
 >>> galois.poly_factors(irr)
 ([Poly(x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1, GF(2))], [1]) # only two factors i.e. 1 & self
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    One more operation which I need to perform on finite field elements is <i>inverse</i>. Multiplicative
                    inverse can be easily calculated using lookup table ( good for small field sizes ).
                </p>

                <p class="blogText">
                    Now if I check result of multiplication of <span class="highlight">129</span> & <span class="highlight">84</span> in GF(2**8),
                    it must be 1.

                    Now I've to divide byte slice into set of pieces. Each piece will have few symbols, where
                    each symbol is a <b>G</b>alois <b>F</b>ield element & I've already decided to work with GF(2**8).
                    I pack 2 field elements together and create a piece. So, I've 3 pieces, with each of first two having 2 symbols
                    and last one having 1 symbol.

                <p class="blogText">
                    But for performing RLNC, I need to have all pieces consisting of same number of symbols, 
                    which is why I pad 0 at end of last piece.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First I choose piece with coding vector <span class="highlight">[160, 28, 233]</span>, which increases rank to 1
                    compared from rank 0 of empty matrix.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
 >>> mat = gf256([[]]) # empty matrix

 >>> import numpy as np
 >>> np.linalg.matrix_rank(mat)
 0

 >>> mat = gf256([[160, 28, 233]])
 >>> np.linalg.matrix_rank(mat)
 1
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Now I randomly collect piece with coding vector <span class="highlight">[189, 244, 80]</span>, which increases rank to 2.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
 >>> mat = gf256([[160, 28, 233], [189, 244, 80]])
 >>> np.linalg.matrix_rank(mat)
 2
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Though I don't have any piece with coding vector <span class="highlight">[135, 57, 63]</span>,
                    but for a moment I assume I do. Now I check whether this piece is useful or not. And turns out
                    coding matrix's rank doesn't increase, so this <i>imaginary</i> piece can be ignored.
                </p>
                <div class="microlight">
 >>> mat = gf256([[160, 28, 233], [189, 244, 80], [135, 57, 63]])
 >>> np.linalg.matrix_rank(mat)
 2
                </div>
                <p class="blogText">
                    Finally I choose another useful piece i.e. with coding vector 
                    <span class="highlight">[157, 233, 247]</span>, which makes rank of coding matrix 3.
                    Now inverting this 3 x 3 matrix & multiplying with coded pieces, gives me original pieces back.

                    I've successfully coded, recoded & decoded pieces using RLNC.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One thing I noticed, rather than waiting for all pieces to be collected when decoding
                    & then invert the coding matrix, it's better to prograssively decode.
                    As soon as new useful piece is found, coding matrix is converted to <b>r</b>educed <b>r</b>ow <b>e</b>chelon
                    <b>f</b>orm using sort of Gaussian Elimination technique. This keeps matrix prepared for revealing original
                    pieces, and as soon as rank reaches 3 original pieces are readily available.

                    I also append coded piece after respective coding vector i.e. I work with augmented matrix.
                    So I start with <span class="highlight">[160, 28, 233, 185, 176]</span>.

                    I find this idea of progressively decoding as soon as new useful piece comes in
                    from peers, to be more practical.

                    After full RLNC scheme, I plan to understand other variants of RLNC along with their
                    respective benefits & drawbacks. Particularly I've interest in Fulcrum Codes.
                    I plan to make use of RLNC along with custom protocol built on top of TCP/ UDP.
                    RLNC seems to be a good candidate for p2p mesh networks, which need to be explored more.
