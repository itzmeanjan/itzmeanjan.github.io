                    Few weeks back I started working on <span class="highlight">pub0sub - Fast, Light-weight, Ordered Pub/Sub System</span>
                    leveraging power of kernel event loop, addressing C10K while running on a consumer grade machine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> can easily handle > 10k concurrent connections even on consumer grade
                    machine, because it doesn't follow conventional way of writing TCP servers in Go. Generally, one
                    go-routine accepts TCP connection & spawns new go-routine for handling connection throughout its lifetime. This way if objective
                    is to handle > 10k concurrent connections, there're > 10k go-routines. Go scheduler needs
                    to perform expensive context switching for running go-routines on underlying OS threads. For > 10k go-routines
                    cost of context switching is pretty high, when no useful task gets accomplished. Also stack memory requirement
                    for > 10k go-routines is not something neglectable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Avoiding aforementioned path helps in discovering another potential way, where I can ask kernel event loop to watch
                    file descriptors of interest & only inform when some action need to be taken. At a time any of two completion events can happen on socket
                    { <b>READ</b>, <b>WRITE</b> } --- either pre-scheduled reading or writing from socket has been completed,
                    giving opportunity to act on it & schedule next operation. There's no more > 10k go-routines, rather only 2 go-routines ---
                    one used for listening & accepting TCP connections; another for watching & responding to I/O events. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It'll be perfectly okay to
                    add more watcher go-routines ( static, done at system startup phase ), each managing its own kernel event loop and watching some
                    delegated sockets. But in that case newly accepted connections
                    need to be fairly distributed among all event watching loops otherwise some of them becomes <b>hotspot</b>, resulting into
                    performance degradation. Some watcher does more socket watching, some does less. Even it's possible some topics
                    in pub/sub are popular and all subscribers interested in those topics needs to be distributed across
                    available watchers. For orchestrating N-sockets on available M-watchers, <i>where N >>> M</i>, I need to keep additional
                    state information in listener go-routine. It can also be further explored whether dynamic watcher adding/ removing in runtime as per system state
                    brings any improvement or not.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Back to current implementation, as a result, lesser time spent in context switching more time spent doing actual work. As soon as new connection
                    is accepted, it's delegated to watcher. On the other hand watcher waits for I/O completion events & 
                    as soon as some of them are available to act on; it starts looping over them one-by-one ---
                    processing each & scheduling next action on socket.

                    This model of writing TCP server is performant, but brings in some complexities. Previously I could
                    manage each connection's whole life-cycle in its own go-routine --- seperation of concern was well respected.
                    As a result implementation was easier to reason about.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Say in first model, server has two clients --- each being managed in its own go-routine. Pub/Sub Hub is waiting to
                    read message from respective sockets, where each message has two parts
                </p>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Part</th>
                        <th>Size ( in bytes )</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Envelope</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>Keeps OPCODE, BodyLength</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Body</td>
                        <td>N</td>
                        <td>Keeps <i>BodyLength</i>-bytes actual data</td>

                </table>
                <p class="blogText">
                    For one client, go-routine reading envelope and for another one body is being read after envelope reading
                    is done. I'd like to highlight, messages are seperated in two parts because it helps
                    in determining what's length of variable sized body, where envelope length is fixed at 5-bytes.

                    But attaining same behaviour when delegating reading from/ writing to sockets to watcher is little more involved. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For reading message envelope, request is issued; watcher informs when envelope is read. Then envelope is deserialised to
                    figure out how many more bytes to read from socket for consuming message body. N-bytes body reading is
                    again delegated to watcher, which informs as soon as it's done. Now if there're M-clients connected at this moment
                    each of them may be reading any possible part of message. There could be also different kinds of messages --- where OPCODE is
                    encoded in envelope along with body length. Reading handler function needs to remember where it left off
                    last time & what exactly it was doing then, so that it can keep processing later part of message. 
                    This calls for additional state keeping --- resulting into more memory allocation than first model.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's like when first time envelope is read, reading handler function understands what's intention of client
                    and how many more bytes it needs to read from socket to construct message. It puts an entry in <b>ongoing reading
                    table</b>, <i>indexed by socket</i>, along with OPCODE so that appropriate deserialisation
                    handler can be invoked when body reading will be completed; issues N-bytes body reading request; moves on to next event processing step.
                    After sometime when body reading is done on this socket, watcher informs, socket is looked up in <b>ongoing reading table</b>
                    to understand what has happened till now & what to do next with body. And finally intended action is taken
                    on received message and socket entry from <b>ongoing reading table</b> is removed.

                    In <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> there're two kinds of clients i.e. { publisher, subscriber }. Each
                    of them interact with Pub/Sub server i.e. <span class="highlight">0hub</span> with different intention
                    resulting into different message format. Opcode helps read handler understand how to deserialise 
                    message body or what kind of actions to take on deserialised, structured message
                    & how to eventually respond back to client.

                    With all these pieces Pub/Sub Hub implementation <span class="highlight">0hub</span> shows quite
                    promising performance. I've tested it with 16k concurrent connections on consumer grade machine. I believe
                    if it's tested in containerised environment where virtual overlay networking can be easily used
                    and more ports ( = more clients ) in total are available, <span class="highlight">0hub</span>
                    will break its own record. Some other day I'd like to run that experiment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Recently I started noticing issue with long lived TCP connections --- resulting into abnormal connection termination.
                    I suspect this is due to long lived TCP connections might be idle for long time if publishers are not publishing
                    often or subscribers have subscribed to some infrequently update receiving topics. To address this
                    situation I plan to add periodic heartbeat message passing between client & hub. Heartbeat messages will be of
                    5-bytes --- <i>only envelope, no body</i>. If there's no body, it denotes last 4-bytes of message envelope
                    will be holding 0, only first byte contains opcode ---  10 for ping, 11 for pong. For maintaining backward compatibility
                    envelope size can't be changed, which is why I'm wasting 4 bytes in envelope by only storing 0.
                </p>
                <img class="imgCenter" src="../images/sound-of-heartbeat-ping-pong.jpg">
                <p class="blogText">
                    Every 30 seconds <span class="highlight">0hub</span> sends PING ( opcode = 10 ) message to all connected
                    publishers & subcribers and expects to hear back with PONG ( opcode = 11 ) message. For all those who responded
                    back, their next health check to be scheduled at t+30. Others who didn't respond back, they'll be
                    pinged again upto 3 times at max, each after 30 seconds delay. If they still don't respond back, hub terminates connection
                    with them while cleaning up all resources associated with respective client.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This will hopefully help hub in maintaining connection & related resources only for healthy & active clients, while enabling it
                    in estimating <i>how many subscribers to receive published message on a topic</i> with better precision.
                    This estimation calculation will pose a challenge during implementing distributed version of <span class="highlight">pub0sub</span> --- which I'll
                    face very soon.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These PING/ PONG messages are simply an overhead, though unavoidable, consuming bandwidth overtime. But I can probably
                    reduce #-of health checking done. When hub and client has recently communicated for sake of their
                    usual business procedure, it's quite evident connection is active --- health check can be avoided. Idea is to only do
                    health check when hub hasn't heard from client for some time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If some active publisher sends message publish intent every < 30s, it can avoid explicit health check cost. On other hand subscribers
                    listening to active topic i.e. frequent update receiving topic, can avoid
                    health check because connection issues will be caught when attempting to push update. That's why I call
                    health check <b>LAZY</b>.
                    As each health check message & response wastes 4-bytes for sake of backward compatibility, it's better
                    to keep its usage as low as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another way I'm looking at --- it's possible to send PING ( opcode = 10 ) message from hub to client
                    of only 1-byte length i.e. OPCODE part of whole message, but when client responds back with PONG ( opcode = 11 )
                    then need to send only envelope i.e. 5-bytes, as proposed 👆. This way communication pattern becomes
                    somewhat asymmetric, but helps in saving 4-bytes, resulting into health check round-trip with 6-bytes
                    instead of previous 10-bytes.
