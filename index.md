## About

Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Anjan Roy**. I am a Software Engineer, originally from **India**.

In 2018, after completing my under-graduate in Computer Science, I started practising software development while continuing post-graduate study in Computer Science. In 2020, after earning *M.Sc. in Computer Science*, I moved to industry full-time. 

I'm working as a **Senior Cryptography Engineer** @ [Cryptography Research Center, Technology Innovation Institute, Abu Dhabi](https://tii.ae/cryptography).

Currently I practise *Applied Cryptography*. Being an avid open source enthusiast, I myself develop and maintain some open source projects. Find them [here](https://github.com/itzmeanjan).

## Education

I did my **B.Sc. & M.Sc. in Computer Science** from Dept. of Computer & System Sciences, [Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan, India](https://visvabharati.ac.in/index.html). 

You may be interested in taking a look at my [CV](./cv/myCV.pdf).
